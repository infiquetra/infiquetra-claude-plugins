    Both raw doors -- ``herdr agent prompt`` and ``herdr pane run`` -- exist only inside this
    class, and ``write`` is the only method that opens either, so an unguarded pane write is
    not something a caller can forget to prevent: there is no call that performs one. Before
    each write, ``write`` asks ``should_guard_pane_write`` whether the composer must be
    inspected first, using its own record of whether it has already written into this session
    (``wrote``). That record is the writer's, scoped to one delivery, never a value threaded by
    hand across callers -- four repair rounds on this file each satisfied a finding at one call
    site and left the adjacent site's flag stale; the picker's two writes were the last such
    site (issue 907 terminal review cycle 2, F39/F40/F41/F46).

    ``wrote_before`` seeds the record: false for a fresh launch, whose first write into a tab
    this launcher created seconds earlier is the one write the rule exempts; true for a
    redelivery and for Orchestrate's later senders, where a person may have typed since.

    Doors. ``door="prompt"`` is ``herdr agent prompt``, the right door for an agent that reports
    interactive readiness; one that never does -- qwen today -- refuses it, and the line is typed
    into the pane instead, as the operator would by hand, up to the length a pane still carries
    as an instruction (``pane_text``). ``door="pane"`` types verbatim: the OpenCode picker is
    driven with keystrokes, not prompts. Both are bounded by ``PANE_WRITE_SECONDS``; a write
    that times out on either door is a named stop saying the line may or may not have reached
    the session, and the prompt door never falls through to the pane behind a timeout -- that
    would be the second delivery every guard in this file exists to prevent. A writer with no
