"""The roster helper — stand up and tear down one herdr session per staffed role (#1024).

``roster.py up`` reads an issue's run record, resolves every role its staffing plan names to a
vendor, a model, an effort and a prompt from the roles library, and creates one named herdr pane
per role. ``roster.py wait`` waits for those panes to settle. ``roster.py down`` closes exactly the
panes the record says this helper created, and nothing else.

Four rules shape the whole file, and each one is a plan decision with a test behind it:

**Panes are created through the launcher, never through raw herdr calls** (plan KTD1). The launcher
beside this file already owns the single door into a pane, the staged-input stop, and a launch
receipt whose ``owned`` field is computed from a pre-launch tab snapshot. Teardown proves ownership
from that receipt. There is no ``herdr agent close`` subcommand at all — closing is a tab operation
that the launcher performs — so re-implementing creation here would mean re-implementing the
ownership proof too, weakly.

**The record is the only authority on what may be closed** (plan R4). ``down`` never reads
``herdr agent list`` to decide. A live pane that this helper did not record is invisible to it.

**The wait always carries a timeout, and a blocked agent is reported rather than answered**
(plan R6, R7). ``herdr agent wait`` without ``--timeout`` waits forever, and without ``--until``
matches herdr's own settled set of idle, done and blocked — which is exactly the settled-state
default this helper wants.

**Every command refuses outside a herdr pane** (plan R8), with one line and exit 4.

Exit codes extend the run record's table (plan KTD6) rather than inventing a parallel one:

===== ======================================================================
 code  meaning
===== ======================================================================
  0    success
  1    an unexpected internal error
  2    a refusal: usage, an unreadable record, an unstaffable role, a failed
       launch or close
  3    the record carries a version this saga does not know
  4    this process is not running inside a herdr pane
  5    a role is blocked, or its wait timed out
