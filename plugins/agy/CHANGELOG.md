# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.1] - 2026-07-05

### Added

- `agy-coder` agent: add validated `effort: medium` frontmatter field, consuming the fleet
  effort convention (#363) — proves the first-class effort vocabulary applies fleet-wide, not
  saga-only.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-30

### Added

- Register the `agy` plugin with `/agy:delegate`, `agy-coder`, and `agy-reviewer`.
- Add the shared `agy.delegation.v1` wrapper with validation-only, supervised foreground `agy`
  launch, run leases, evidence bundles, clone-backed diff derivation, write-set enforcement, and
  guarded `patch-only` / `auto-if-clean` apply policies at
  `plugins/agy/scripts/agy_delegate.py`.
- Add static prompt-contract tests, wrapper policy tests, harness transcript auditing, and live
  Claude Code harness proof for reviewer and coder flows.
