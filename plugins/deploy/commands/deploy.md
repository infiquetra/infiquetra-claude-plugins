description: Promote an Infiquetra repository by minting a policy-compliant deployment tag
argument-hint: "[nonprod|staging|production] [version] [--dry-run]"
---

Promote an Infiquetra repository through the tag-promotion deployment workflow.

## Instructions

1. Load `deploy/skills/deploy-state/SKILL.md`.
2. Confirm the target repository resolves to `github.com/infiquetra/*`.
3. Confirm the target environment is `nonprod`, `staging`, or `production`.
4. If the item being promoted is saga-tracked, accept its deploy handoff first — see
   "Accepting a saga handoff" in `deploy/skills/deploy-state/SKILL.md`: read the offer with
   `deploy_handoff.py read`, record the ack with `deploy_handoff.py accept`, and consult
   `authorize_promotion` before proceeding (a `gate` payload never auto-fires).
5. Preview the tag and workflow URL before mutating anything.
6. Use `plugins/deploy/scripts/mint_tag.py` for deterministic tag naming.
7. For production, rollback, or hotfix work, state the blast radius and ask for explicit
   confirmation before pushing a tag.

python3 plugins/deploy/scripts/mint_tag.py \
