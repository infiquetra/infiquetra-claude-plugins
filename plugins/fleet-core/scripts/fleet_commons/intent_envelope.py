"""Canonical fleet IntentEnvelope — the one committed run-start posture schema (#380).

Run-start posture — attended vs. unattended, which ceremony gates apply, what spend
posture follows — used to be asked (or silently assumed) independently at five-plus
sites across the fleet. This module is the single shared primitive they all resolve
through instead: one schema (:class:`IntentEnvelope`), one composed run-start
interview (:data:`INTERVIEW`, the registry the fleet drift-guard test checks against),
one mode-keyed defaults matrix (:func:`recommend_tier` / :func:`self_select_posture`),
and one spend-posture resolver (:func:`spend_posture` / :func:`resolve_spend_action`).

Canonical home: ``plugins/fleet-core/scripts/fleet_commons/`` (the fleet-commons
mechanism, DECISIONS ``{#fleet-commons-mechanism-463}``) because the envelope has
consumers in three plugins — saga (``/outcome`` start, ``OutcomeSpec.intent``,
``ExecutionSpec.intent``), team-execution (Step B1 posture check), and
mission-control (issue-capture validation). saga re-exports this module through
``plugins/saga/scripts/intent_envelope.py`` (the issue's proposed path), exactly as
``execution_spec.py`` re-exports ``tier_palette``.

Vocabulary discipline: the schema is CLOSED at each ``SCHEMA_VERSION`` — an unknown
top-level key, an off-vocabulary value, or a foreign schema version is an error,
never a pass (fail closed, never enumerate-and-shrug). Extensions are made by
EDITING this module — never by consumers tolerating keys they do not understand.
#373 landed its extension here as OPTIONAL, additive keys of schema v1
(``backends_permitted`` / ``degrade_policy`` / ``spend_envelope``): an absent key
means "posture not captured" and every pre-#373 v1 envelope round-trips
byte-identical with unchanged meaning, so no committed envelope is force-migrated.
The closed-schema rule is unchanged — the three keys are now part of v1's closed
key set, and anything outside it remains an error. Future extensions (#449's
envelope tokens, #372/#433's mid-run amendment verbs) follow the same rule: edit
here, additive-optional where the old meaning is preserved, version-bump where it
is not.

Threat model (read before trusting a field):

* ``source`` / ``authored_by`` / ``authored_at`` are **self-attested** provenance
  labels. Nothing here verifies that the named author really answered the interview
  or that the stated source is genuine — a forged envelope on an issue body is
  syntactically indistinguishable from a real one. Consumers must treat the envelope
  as *the operator's recorded intent*, not as an authorization credential.
* The envelope **authorizes nothing by itself**. ``ceremony_gates`` values only ever
  make a consumer MORE conservative than its own default or record an operator
  choice the consumer separately enforces; the ``AUTONOMOUS_UNDER_ENVELOPE`` write
  class with real token check + revocation is #449's separate mechanism, not this
  schema. In particular ``merge: "auto"`` / ``deploy_nonprod: "auto"`` here are a
  recorded operator decision that downstream gate machinery (the reversibility
  certificate, which today always GATEs merge/deploy) may consult — this module
  grants no write path.
* :func:`resolve_spend_action`'s ``approval_token`` is an opaque presence check
  (was an explicit operator approval supplied alongside the spend increase?) — it is
  not validated against an issuer or a revocation list in v1; #449 owns that.
* The #373 dispatch-seam fields only ever NARROW what a dispatch may do relative to
  the uncaptured default: ``backends_permitted`` intersects with (never extends) the
  host's runtime-available set, ``degrade_policy`` restricts the existing
  presence-conditional degrade to at most one ladder rung (or forbids it outright),
  and ``spend_envelope`` adds a HALT-only pre-dispatch gate. None of them grants a
  write path or capability the consumer did not already have.
* :func:`authorize_spend` reads **leaf-produced, self-attested actuals** (the
  ``outcome_costs`` ledger): a leaf that under-reports or never reports its cost is
  not measured against the ceiling. The gate bounds honest spend drift; it is not a
  defense against a lying leaf.

No I/O at import; the only file the module reads is via the sibling tier registry
(``tier_resolver`` -> ``tier_policy.json``), loaded lazily on first tier lookup.
