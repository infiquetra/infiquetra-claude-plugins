"""The widen-only union: a pattern floor a model may raise but never lower (issue 1036).

Two places in this fleet decide something with a hand-written regular expression
and decide it too narrowly.  This module is the one place that pairs such a
pattern with a yes/no model judgment and takes the union, so the model can only
ever turn a ``False`` into a ``True``.

Three properties this module exists to guarantee:

* **Widen-only.** ``union = floor or probability >= threshold``.  There is no
  code path in which a floor of ``True`` produces a union of ``False``, whatever
  the model answers and whatever goes wrong.
* **Fail open to the floor.** An error, a timeout, a malformed body, a missing
  key, a missing answer, a non-numeric probability: every one of them leaves the
  floors exactly as the caller supplied them and names the reason in ``note``.
  A caller that ignores ``note`` still behaves as it did before this module
  existed.
* **One call path, injectable.** ``ask`` defaults to ``typesafe_client.ask`` and
  is a parameter, so a test hands in a function returning a recorded answer map
  and cannot reach the network even by accident.
