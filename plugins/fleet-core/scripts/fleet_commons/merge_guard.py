"""merge_guard — the one implementation of "never publish a merge that reverts a newer branch".

Card 875 asked for a guard that refuses a merge which would take a file backwards relative to the
branch it is measured against. Issue 1025 built it inside the orchestrate driver; issue 1028 gives
saga a merge turn of its own and needs the same refusal, so the rule lives here, in the component
saga already resolves through ``fleet_commons_shim``.

**The orchestrate driver keeps its own copy, deliberately.** ``orchestrate.py`` documents at its
plugin resolver why it must not take a resolution dependency on another plugin for something it
needs when that plugin is absent, and a safety guard is exactly the thing that must not depend on an
install. Two copies of a safety rule is still how one of them stops matching the other, so
``tests/test_merge_guard.py`` drives both through one case table and fails if they diverge. The
equivalence test is what keeps one rule from becoming two, in place of an import that would make
orchestrate fail to load on a machine without fleet-core.

Two functions, and the order between them is the whole point:

* :func:`fetch_comparison_branch` refreshes ``<remote>/<branch>`` and returns a refusal when the
  fetch fails. A guard evaluated against a stale remote-tracking reference passes silently, which
  is the failure card 875 actually reported, so a failed fetch refuses the turn rather than
  letting the comparison run on whatever was last pulled.
* :func:`regression_files` names the files the merge would take backwards. Empty means it reverts
  nothing.

Neither function merges, writes, or decides anything. The caller owns the turn; this owns the
question "would publishing this result undo work that is already on the comparison branch?".

The reading in :func:`regression_files` is deliberately narrow: only a file the comparison branch
has changed since the two diverged, AND that this merge result also touches, can be reverted by
publishing the merge. Refusing every merge whose branch is merely behind the comparison branch
would make ordinary parallel work unmergeable, which is a refusal nobody would keep.

House pattern: pure functions over explicit values, an injectable runner so a test drives real git
in a temporary repository (or a fake, where the point is the refusal text), and no I/O at import.
