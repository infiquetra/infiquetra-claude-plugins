"""Shared 429 retry/backoff primitive — the fleet's one rate-limit response (issue #348).

Lives in fleet-commons (issue #463 / DECISIONS ``{#fleet-commons-mechanism-463}``) so every plugin that
can hit a 429 imports ONE implementation instead of re-writing a bespoke handler. Consumers load it via
their vendored ``fleet_commons_shim``: ``fleet_commons_shim.load("retry_backoff")``.

Three entry points:

* ``retry_with_backoff(fn, *, on_status=429, ...)`` — jittered exponential backoff, attempt cap,
  non-retryable pass-through. A non-429 error propagates immediately; a 429 is retried (honoring a
  ``Retry-After`` hint when supplied) up to ``max_attempts``.
* ``bridge_call(fn, *, breaker, ...)`` — wraps ``retry_with_backoff`` and drives a ``CircuitBreaker``
  (OPEN on a run of rate-limit failures, cooldown, HALF-OPEN probe, CLOSE on success) so a provider
  bridge stops hammering a rate-limited endpoint.
* ``parse_retry_after(value, *, now=time.time)`` — both RFC 7231 ``Retry-After`` forms (delta-seconds
  and HTTP-date) reduced to a non-negative delay in seconds, or ``None`` when there is no usable hint.

stdlib-only, pure over injected ``sleep``/``rng``/``clock``/``now`` seams (deterministic tests). Content
changes here are additive-only within fleet-core 0.x — a consumer never breaks because fleet-core updated.

    Both forms the specification allows are accepted:

    * **delta-seconds** — a count of seconds (``Retry-After: 120``). An already-numeric hint is
      accepted unchanged, so a caller that pre-parses the header keeps its current behaviour.
    * **HTTP-date** — an absolute instant (``Retry-After: Fri, 31 Dec 2100 23:59:59 GMT``), converted
      to the seconds remaining until it. Real controllers send this form; a caller that ran the raw
      header through ``int()`` raised ``ValueError`` instead of backing off, and the raised
      ``ValueError`` carries no 429 status, so the rate-limit retry was skipped entirely.

    A date already in the past yields ``0.0`` — retry now, never a negative delay. An absent, empty,
    or unparseable value yields ``None``, which the caller reads as "the server gave no usable hint"
    and answers with computed jittered backoff. A non-finite value — ``inf``, ``nan``, or an overlarge
    literal like ``1e400``, all of which ``float()`` accepts — is unusable in the same way and also
    yields ``None``, so it can never reach a caller's ``math.ceil`` and cost it its typed 429 surface.

    Clamping to ``max_delay`` stays with the caller (``_retry_delay``), so a numeric hint and a date
    hint are bounded identically.

    ``now`` returns epoch seconds and is injected for deterministic tests (the breaker's ``clock``
    seam is monotonic and is a different clock; an HTTP-date needs wall time).
