"""Client for the TypeSafe System One evaluation endpoint (plan U2 + U3).

One calling interface, two transports.  The official ``typesafe-sdk`` package is
used where it can be imported; a dependency-free ``urllib.request`` transport
serves hooks and scripts that run outside this project's environment.  Both
produce the same :class:`AskResult`, so a caller cannot tell them apart.

Three properties this module exists to guarantee:

* **The key never leaks.**  It is read through the injected environment reader at
  request-build time and placed only in the ``Authorization`` header.  It is not
  a field of any result, is never logged, and is never interpolated into an
  exception message.
* **State is redacted before any transport sees it.**  ``prepare_state`` is the
  only way to build the payload a transport accepts, and a transport refuses
  state that does not carry its marker.  The data rule is a mechanism, not a
  convention (``plugins/fleet-core/references/typesafe.md``).
* **Failure is never mistaken for success.**  Every outcome maps onto the closed
  vocabulary ``ok`` / ``error`` / ``timeout`` / ``malformed``, mirroring
  ``plugins/saga/scripts/engine_bridge_http.py``.
