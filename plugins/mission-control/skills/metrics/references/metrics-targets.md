# SDLC Flow Metrics Reference

Quick reference for Infiquetra board-flow metrics. Source of truth:

## Cycle Time

**Definition**: Time from first active ownership to terminal workflow status.

| Board | Start | Terminal |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Operations / Asgard / CAMPPS | `Active` stage | `Ready to close` |

> **What the tool measures today.** `metrics cycle-time` keys the start off the
> **Status** field, not the Stage column: `_cycle_start_statuses` in
> `scripts/sdlc_manager.py` returns the literal `Active`, which the board-stage
> migration retired as a Status value. So the command matches nothing on any board
> until that function is moved onto the Stage field. The boundary above is the
> intended definition; it is not what the current code computes. Tracked separately
> from issue #1020, whose scope is the cached census and the prose describing it.


Legacy (read-only history): the retired `Mount Olympus` board used `Assigned` as start with
`Done`/`Closed`/`Cancelled` terminals; its history may include `In Progress`, `In Development`,
or `Deployed`. Tooling reads those for historical calculations only and creates no new movement
with those names.

**Measurement**: P50, P85, and P95 via GitHub timeline events
(`ProjectV2ItemFieldValueEvent` on the Status field).

### Targets by Issue Type

| Type | P85 Target | SLA if applicable |
|------|------------|-------------------|
| Capability | < 5 days | -- |
| Enhancement | < 2 days | -- |
| Defect | < 1 day | Critical: 4 hours; high: 1 day; medium: 3 days |
| Exploration | < 3 days | -- |
| Context Update | < 1 day | -- |

## Throughput

**Definition**: Number of work items moved to a terminal workflow status per week.

**Use**: Capacity planning, delivery forecasting, and trend analysis.

| Board | Counted terminal status |
|-------|-------------------------|
| Operations / Asgard / CAMPPS | `Ready to close` |

---

## WIP Age

**Definition**: How long current active items have been in their current Status.

**Use**: Identify stale work, trigger escalation, and surface bottlenecks.

| Board | Status | Threshold |
|-------|--------|-----------|
| Operations / Asgard / CAMPPS | every non-terminal Status | > 3 days |

`_active_age_thresholds` in `scripts/sdlc_manager.py` derives this from the
workflow: every stage-flow Status that is not terminal, at three days. The
boards are not split and no board carries a longer threshold.

---

## Flow Efficiency

**Definition**: Active work time divided by total cycle time.

All three boards share one ladder: active work is the `Active` and `Verify`
stages. `Intake`, `Shaping` and `Planning` are wait or preparation states
unless a card's evidence shows otherwise.

Target: greater than 50%.

## How to Read Metrics

### When Cycle Time Is Over Target

1. Run `metrics column-time` on slow items.
2. Check WIP age for active or review bottlenecks.
3. Look for `Blocked`, `Needs Question`, or missing Jeff decision signals.
4. Confirm deployment delay is not being misread as workflow delay.
5. Use a longer `--days` window to separate noise from a trend.

### When Throughput Is Low

1. Check how much work sits in the `Active` stage at once.
2. Look at active-status aging.
3. Check if `Ready for Planning` is empty or poorly shaped.
4. Look at defect rate and unplanned work.
5. Consider whether large capabilities should be split.

### When WIP Age Is High

1. Identify the specific cards and discuss them in board review.
2. Add or confirm `blocked` / `Needs Question` state where appropriate.
3. Swarm, split, or move the card back to shaping if the issue is not actually ready.
