"""Tests for W6/U4 — the KTD12 writer census gate (issue #87, Plan Review D2).

The invariant: ``QUERY_SET_FIELD_VALUE`` (:874) is the ONE GraphQL mutation
that writes a project-field value in this plugin. The census anchors on that
CONSTANT — not on the ``_set_project_field_value`` helper, whose caller list
missed ``board_move`` (the D2 failure) — and is enforced as an AST allowlist
over every function whose body references it. A new function that starts
writing project fields fails this test on the next run.

With U6 shipped, the allowlist contains no lifecycle writers:
``_set_project_field_value`` serves the constrained mutation (and every
non-lifecycle field), and ``_sync_label_fields_for_item`` is inert unless a
project config declares ``label_fields``.
