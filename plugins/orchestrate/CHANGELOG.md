# Changelog

## [1.19.0] - 2026-08-20

Group A combines the first three run-integrity repairs with the documentation-and-hygiene unit.

### Fixed

- **U1 — `land` no longer touches or refuses the operator's working tree.** Unit branches merge in
  a detached throwaway worktree, the run branch advances explicitly, successful worktrees are
  removed, and conflicting worktrees are retained and named for recovery. After the operator
  resolves and commits a conflict there, a rerun publishes only an exact two-parent merge of the
  current run tip and current unit tip, using the same guarded reference advance as the ordinary
  path. Once that merge is published, its conflict pointer is cleared before cleanup; a cleanup
  failure no longer blocks later units, and a clean exact merge already in run-branch history is
  cleaned up on retry. Missing landing directories have stale Git registrations pruned before
  reuse even when `clean` already cleared the record pointer. Retained-worktree refusals now
  distinguish unresolved changes, a non-merge `HEAD`, a missing unit match, and a moved run-branch
  base without weakening the publication gate. `clean --all` preserves any recovery work it
  reports as kept, and its help names that retention. The checked-out-run-branch warning names the
  staged-deletion hazard and recovery command, and cleanup failure reports completed merges under
  its own exit status instead of calling the land a merge failure. Before a leftover landing
  worktree is reused, it is detached at the current run tip and its `HEAD` is read back; a failed
  checkout or mismatch restores the existing inspect-or-remove refusal instead of merging on a
  stale base and rewinding the run branch. Reuse admission now proves the canonical landing path is
  a live, separate linked worktree before any path-scoped Git command runs: Git must list the path,
  `git -C` must resolve back to that exact top level, and neither the primary nor operator worktree
  may match. This refuses the whole enclosing-repository escape class, including plain leftover
  directories, stale or prunable registrations whose directory reappears, and symlinks resolving to
  the repository root, before Git can detach the operator checkout.
- **U2 — a missing run branch fails loudly instead of producing false unit results.** The branch is
  resolved once when a run loads; `status`, `check`, and `clean` remain available for diagnosis,
  while `go` and `land` refuse with the missing branch named, even when no unit is eligible. `adopt`
  also remains available: it names the missing branch and conservatively marks a stranded unit
  without a live session as failed when commit-based classification is unavailable.
- **U3 — delivery warnings and unit status are honest and readable.** Warnings append to existing
  notes, clear after a commit, and appear in `status` and `check`; the status table now handles long
  model names and multiline tasks while showing commit counts and landed state. Pane handover notes
  and pane-fallback diagnostics both append, including when a long task has no setup lines. Task and
  note columns are both bounded, and one run-branch history walk classifies every unit's landed
  state instead of repeating that walk for each row; the unused single-unit wrapper is removed.
- **U11 — local state and documentation match the plugin that ships.** `start` idempotently excludes
  `.orchestrate/` through the driven repository's local Git exclude file, hand-authored briefs use
  `.orchestrate/tasks/`, and the README documents only `orchestrate.py` and `herdr_events.py`. The
  exclude path is resolved from the repository root even when `start` runs in a subdirectory, and
  an existing final rule without a newline is preserved correctly.
- **Run and adoption paths use Git's real path and ref shapes.** A run identifier must be one safe
  path component before the run branch or landing directory is created. `adopt` now matches Git's
  `refs/heads/` worktree output to a stored short branch name, so it recovers the live worktree and
  Herdr session instead of rebuilding an incomplete unit row.

## [1.18.0] - 2026-08-19

Sixteen fixes found by watching real runs rather than by anything erroring. The unifying shape:
work reported as done that was never attempted, and predicates that measured the wrong thing.

### Fixed

- **`clean --merged` reaped units that were still working.** `landed()` counted commits ahead of the
  run branch and answered yes at zero -- which is also exactly what a unit that has not committed
  *yet* looks like -- and `cmd_clean` never consulted `unit.status`. It closed the tabs and removed
  the worktrees of two builds and two reviews that were mid-flight. `landed()` now distinguishes
  three states, and nothing-to-land is no longer the same answer as landed; `--merged` requires
  `DONE` as well. `land --clean` reaps only the units that invocation merged, so work an earlier
  invocation deliberately kept stays kept.

- **`settle` treated a single idle sample as finished, and `wait` did the same.** An agent is also
  idle *between* turns. One sample marked a unit done while it was still working: it had two commits
  at the time and finished with ten. Both now require agreeing observations, `--interval` apart.
  `wait` has no single-sample escape hatch: `--once` is gone and a confirmation count below two is
  rejected, because a deliberate single-sample wait is the defect with a flag on it.

- **`wait`'s fallback path leaked processes and ignored its own timeout.** It discarded the child's
  exit status and restarted with a fresh full budget -- `wait --timeout 1` ran for 1.505 seconds and
  launched 31 child processes. It now enforces one monotonic deadline across restarts. The fallback
  also waits on `blocked`, which it never did: an agent stuck on a question was invisible until the
  helper timed out, thirty minutes at the default.

- **Launcher flags were emitted where the vendor sees them.** `launch_args` was appended after the
  vendor token, so `--workspace` reached the agent as a native argument and a live session landed in
  the caller's workspace. The two positions turn out to be mutually exclusive -- `--workspace` works
  only before the vendor token, `--company-account` only after it -- so workspace placement is now a
  first-class `workspace` field that the plugin positions itself. `launch_args` keeps its position
  and meaning unchanged.

- **`produced_anything` counted other units' commits.** It measured from the run's original base, so
  any unit created after the first land inherited the landed commits and read as productive before
  its session wrote a line. That silently disabled the `NO COMMITS` warning and defeated the
  dependency gate that exists because a doc-review unit once reviewed a plan document that was never
  written.

- **A land that hit a conflict discarded the announcements for merges that had already succeeded.**
  Units are announced the moment their own merge lands, so a later conflict cannot un-announce an
  earlier success.

- **A failed board writeback reported a successful land.** The comment was attempted even when the
  status write had failed, and `land` returned success either way -- and since the unit was by then
  merged, no later land retried. `land`'s exit status is now three-way, so a caller can tell a land
  that failed to merge from a land whose merges worked but whose writeback did not.

- **A unit name could write outside the task directory.** The spill path was built straight from the
  name, so an absolute name discarded the directory and `..` traversed out of it. Names are
  validated as a single path component, and every task file must resolve beneath the task directory
  on save and on load. One over-broad `except OSError` is narrowed to `FileNotFoundError`: a
  directory standing where the spill file should be was absorbed as "the file is gone", and that
  path also cleared the pointer, making the loss permanent.

- **A legacy run with no stored run branch stopped recognising its own merged work**, so `check`
  reported `NO COMMITS` against work that had landed and `clean` would not reap it.

- **A land finished by hand is no longer guessed at.** A conflicted land tells the operator to
  finish with `git merge --no-ff`, which produces the shape every helper reads correctly. Inferring
  a fast-forward land from a recorded branch point was tried and reverted: it let an empty unit that
  merged the advanced run branch read as landed, which reached `clean --merged` and would have
  released its dependents. The conservative false negative -- a hand-finished fast-forward reads as
  empty -- is the deliberate tradeoff.

### Added

- **The lifecycle writes back to GitHub.** A run may carry an `issues` mapping, and `land` moves the
  card and posts one progress comment at each phase boundary, through saga's reconcile controller so
  the existing allowlist and idempotency keys apply. A run without the mapping writes nothing, and a
  missing saga never fails a land. `announce` is the operator's door for a boundary land did not
  cover. This closes a gap where nine phases across six vendors left a card on `Idea`, still
  labelled `needs-plan`, with zero comments.

- **`serialize`, an ordering edge that claims no output.** `after` means "I build on what you
  produce"; `serialize` means "do not run beside me" without asserting a dependency that does not
  exist. Both gate launch identically and `status` names which kind of wait holds a unit. The
  command and skill document when to use each, and a contract test fails if either forgets.

- **`diff`**, which shows what a unit itself changed, measured from its merge base and naming that
  base in the output. Diffing a unit against the run branch reports its siblings' work as its own
  deletions -- in one run it showed a 391-line test file as deleted by a unit that never touched it.

- **`check` reports `LOOKS DONE`** -- a unit the record calls running whose session is idle and whose
  branch has commits. That is the drift that quietly stalls a run.

- **`start` validates dependency names**, which only `expand` did. A typo in the first plan produced
  a unit that was never eligible, forever.

- **Long unit tasks spill out of the run record.** On a real 75-unit run, 83% of a 268 KB `run.json`
  was task prose, rewritten on every save and unreadable by anyone. Callers see no difference.

## [1.17.0] - 2026-08-17

### Added

- **`roster` now briefs every vendor it lists.** Under each one it prints both permission modes as
  they will actually be passed, whether saga is installed and how that vendor invokes it, and any
  behaviour that has caught a run out before. All of it resolved at the moment of asking rather than
  recalled.

  This is the answer to a recurring failure rather than a nicety: a vendor's behaviour was split
  across five separate tables, so where a table had a gap the orchestrator improvised — plausibly,
  and only found out a phase later. In one week that produced a builder reviewing its own work, a
  planner blocked on a question nobody could see, a task delivered as an attachment, and a unit
  prompted while still booting.

  Notes are carried for the quirks no table had room for: qwen never reports interactive readiness
  and its `--safe-mode` is not a permission flag; muse's `--yolo` disables the sandbox as well as
  approval, so it is bypass rather than auto; opencode's effort is a picker that cannot be answered
  from an unwatched tab; agy's saga plugin is a symlink into the operator's own checkout; codex ships
  saga as skills and prefixes with `$`.

### Note on what was deliberately not built

An earlier plan was to have `roster --probe` verify every claimed flag by trying it. Testing the
method first killed it: every vendor short-circuits `--help` before validating arguments, so the
cheap trial cannot tell an accepted flag from a rejected one, and the only trial that works is a real
prompt-mode run — whose invocation differs per vendor, which is the same stale vocabulary the probe
was meant to escape. A non-existent flag is already caught at launch by the delivery check added in
1.16.0, and a flag that exists but means the wrong thing — muse's `--yolo` — is caught by no probe at
all. Reading the vendor's own semantics is the only thing that catches that class, which is what
these notes are.

## [1.16.0] - 2026-08-17

### Fixed

- **A session was given its task before it could read one.** `launch` sent the moment the wrapper
  returned, but the wrapper returns when the *tab* exists, which is earlier than the agent being able
  to read anything. Sending into that gap does not fail: `herdr agent prompt` reports success, the
  agent finishes booting, and the prompt is gone. Observed three times across two vendors on a single
  live run — twice on qwen, once on agy — always with the same tell: a unit idle immediately after
  launch, having consumed nothing. `settle` reads that idle as **done**, and only `land` notices a
  phase later that it committed nothing.

  `launch` now waits for the agent to report it can take a prompt before sending, and checks
  afterwards that the session actually started. An agent that never reports readiness at all — qwen —
  has nothing to wait for, so the window is simply spent, which is still later than sending
  instantly.

  The check **reports rather than repairs**: a resend risks handing a unit its task twice, and a unit
  that quietly did nothing is worth a line in `status` more than it is worth a guess.

### Added

- **When to give a run more than one workspace.** A workspace is the unit of attention, not of
  isolation — that is the worktree. Below about six concurrent units, one workspace is right and a
  second is overhead; above it, one workspace becomes a wall of tabs and the operator can no longer
  see what is waiting on them. One issue is one lifecycle and a lifecycle is the natural workspace,
  so a parent with nine children is nine workspaces plus the umbrella the orchestrator sits in.

  Including the sharp edge: the agent wrapper's `--workspace` takes a **name**, so handing it an
  existing workspace ID creates a new workspace called that rather than joining the one you meant.

- **The remedy for append-only files conflicting on a wide phase.** Nine planners each appending to
  the same engineering journal is a conflict on every land after the first, though every entry is
  distinct and all should survive. Git's built-in union merge driver, set locally in
  `.git/info/attributes`, keeps both sides with no markers — noted for journals and changelogs, and
  explicitly not for source.

## [1.15.0] - 2026-08-17

### Fixed

- **muse's constrained mode was full bypass.** Both `auto` and `bypass` were `--yolo`, which muse's
  own help defines as "disable approval and sandboxing and trust this workspace for this run". So a
  unit asking for the constrained mode ran unsandboxed — a safety claim backwards. `auto` is now
  `--approval-mode never`, which stops muse asking without dropping the sandbox; `bypass` stays
  `--yolo`.

- **qwen had no way to escalate at all.** Both modes were empty. `--yolo` is absent from
  `qwen --help` and works anyway — verified by running it, against a control showing qwen rejects an
  unknown flag with "Unknown arguments". Its own warning names the equivalent: "running headless
  with `--yolo` / approval-mode=yolo and no sandbox".

- **agy could not be given saga work.** Orchestrate reported zero capabilities for it, so any
  `/saga:` unit aimed at agy was refused outright. agy is Antigravity and its home is the Gemini
  config directory, where the plugin is a **symlink** into the operator's own checkout rather than a
  fetched cache — so a search for directories named `saga` finds only the saga *state*. With the
  path added, agy reports 24 capabilities including `plan`, `doc-review` and `code-review`.

### Changed

- **opencode's effort is recorded as unreachable rather than implied.** It is a variant — Default,
  high, max — chosen through `/variants`, which opens a picker rather than taking an argument, and a
  picker cannot be answered from a `setup` line in an unwatched tab. The command document now says
  to offer opencode on its model and leave the variant to the operator.

- A note against ever mapping qwen's `--safe-mode` to a permission mode: it reads like the opposite
  of `--yolo` and actually disables every customization, including the extensions saga loads.

## [1.14.0] - 2026-08-17

### Fixed

- **`clean --merged` could not reap anything until the very end of a run.** It asked whether a unit's
  branch was already in the operator's tree. Units land on the *run branch* as each phase finishes,
  and the operator's tree sees none of it until `collect`, once, at the end — so the answer was "no"
  for every unit for the whole run, and the only mode safe to run unattended closed nothing at
  exactly the time sessions pile up. The only way to reap mid-run was bare `clean`, which closes
  everything regardless of whether the work survived, including the worktree that is the evidence a
  unit failed.

  Reapability is now measured against the run branch, which is where `land` puts things. A unit is
  reapable as soon as its phase lands, so `clean --merged` belongs after every `land` rather than
  once at the end — and the command document now says so. A unit that landed nothing still keeps its
  tab and its worktree, and a unit marked `merge: false` is never reaped at all, because its branch
  holds the only copy of its work.

## [1.13.0] - 2026-08-17

### Fixed

- **A real task is too long to type into a pane, and arrived as an attachment nobody acted on.**
  For any vendor that will not take `herdr agent prompt` — qwen today — orchestrate types the task
  into the pane instead. Measured against qwen 0.21.13: 859 characters arrive as typed text, 1660
  arrive as `[Pasted Content N chars]`. The paste is submitted and the agent knows its size; it
  simply does not treat it as the instruction. Verbatim, to a 6402-character task: *"I can see
  you've pasted some content (6402 characters), but I'm not sure what you'd like me to do with it."*

  So the unit launched, the keystrokes were delivered, orchestrate recorded success, and the session
  sat waiting for an instruction it believed it had never been given. It went idle, `settle` marked
  it **done**, and only `land` reported — a phase later — that it had committed nothing. Since a real
  task runs to thousands of characters, that door was unusable for real work.

  Past 800 characters the task is written to `.orchestrate/tasks/<unit>.md` and the typed line points
  at it by absolute path. The leading saga command stays typed, because that is what makes the vendor
  load the skill — inside a file it is just prose. The handover is recorded in the unit's note.

  Verified end to end against a live qwen session: the same task that produced "I'm not sure what
  you'd like me to do with it" as a 6402-character paste is read from the file and answered
  correctly from a 212-character line.

## [1.12.0] - 2026-08-17

### Fixed

- **A dispatched unit no longer stops on a question nobody will see.** Saga's `/plan` names the
  family in its own `SKILL.md`: "Use `AskUserQuestion` for choices from a known set (destination,
  execution backend, scope class, resume-vs-mint)". Orchestrate pre-answered exactly one of those
  four, and the next live run stopped on the destination within minutes of starting — a planner
  sitting blocked in a background tab with the whole run queued behind it, which is the same failure
  the backend note had already fixed once.

  Every dispatched saga task now carries one rule instead: for a choice from a known set, take the
  most defensible option, say which, and continue. Pre-deciding each of the four instead would make
  this plugin model saga's entire question vocabulary and go stale the moment saga adds a fifth —
  the same closed vocabulary that sent a whole review phase around the plugin.

  The other half matters as much: a unit is told **not** to guess a real question about the work.
  "Should this also cover X" is the operator's call, and a confident answer to it produces confident
  work on the wrong thing. The unit writes the question into its output and stops, which is exactly
  what `settle` and the orchestrator are already watching for.

## [1.11.0] - 2026-08-17

### Added

- **`check` — report where the run record and the repository disagree.** Read-only; exits non-zero
  when it finds anything. The record is one JSON file and the truth is git plus herdr, and nothing
  watches the gap between them: on the live run for issue 48 a whole review phase was created
  outside the record and neither `land` nor `clean` could see it. Five shapes, each a comparison
  rather than a rule:

  | Finding | Compares |
  |---|---|
  | `UNRECORDED` | a run-owned branch against the unit table |
  | `NO COMMITS` | a unit marked done against its branch |
  | `NOT LANDED` | a unit marked done and set to merge against the run branch |
  | `SESSION GONE` | a unit marked running against herdr |
  | `STILL WORKING` | a unit marked done against herdr |

  `NOT LANDED` is gated on the unit's `merge` intent. Without that gate it fires on every correctly
  handled competing-plan branch, which was measured on the real run: six of seven properly recorded
  units also had unlanded commits.

- **`adopt [--yes]` — put stranded unit branches back into the record.** Rebuilds a unit from what
  is still true: name and branch from the ref, worktree from git, and vendor, pane and tab from the
  live session matched on its working directory. Without `--yes` it writes nothing.

  `task`, `after`, `model`, `effort` and `permission` are left at their defaults rather than guessed.
  They cannot be recovered, and the session has already been given its task, so nothing here is ever
  sent to it again.

### Fixed

- **A command that is not installed is now a result, not a traceback.** `run(..., check=False)`
  promised that every failure comes back as a return code, but `subprocess.run` raises rather than
  returning when the program does not exist — so `check` and `adopt`, which had already decided
  herdr was optional, crashed on any machine without it. Missing now surfaces as return code 127,
  the shell's own "command not found", and `check=True` callers get one sentence instead of a
  traceback. `poll` carried the same latent fault and is fixed by the same change.

### Changed

- `poll` accepts an already-fetched agent list, so a caller looking at every unit pays one herdr
  round trip for the run instead of one per row — an unresponsive herdr costs the timeout once.


## [1.10.0] - 2026-08-16

### Added

- **`launch_args` on a unit — extra arguments for the launcher, carried through untouched.**
  `model` and `effort` are what every vendor has in common; this is everything else the wrapper
  knows and this plugin does not. `--company-account` is the case that forced it: the wrapper
  intercepts that flag and swaps the configuration directory before the tool starts, so it never
  appears in the tool's own `--help` and could not be expressed through a unit at all. On the live
  run for issue 48 the operator asked for it, the plugin could not carry it, and an entire review
  phase was launched by hand — outside the run record, where `land` and `clean` cannot reach it.

  Nothing is validated here on purpose. An allow-list of acceptable flags kept in this file would be
  the same closed vocabulary one level up, going stale silently as the wrapper releases on its own
  schedule. The wrapper already rejects what it does not accept, by name.

- **`merge` on a unit — defaults to `true`; `false` means the branch is to be read, not merged.**
  `land` previously merged every finished unit, which is the one thing the command's own
  documentation forbids for competing plans: several planners writing their own version of one
  document cannot be merged by git without a conflict at best and a silently interleaved plan at
  worst. On the issue-48 run that made `land` unusable, and every merge was done by hand.

  The plugin does not work out which units conflict by comparing branches for overlapping paths.
  That is real work, wrong in both directions, and it decides something the person who wrote the
  phase already knows.

### Changed

- **`land` names the finished units it held back**, alongside the units that committed nothing. A
  branch holding the only copy of something is never quietly left behind — silence would read as
  "everything landed."


## [1.9.0] - 2026-08-16

### Fixed

- **A builder no longer reviews its own work when the run has a review phase.** Saga's `/work`
  Phase 5 calls `/code-review` programmatically as its own pre-PR gate. In a single session that is
  right; under orchestration it is a self-review by the builder's own vendor, which is exactly what
  the roster rule forbids — and the wasted pass is the smaller problem. Phase 5.3 blocks on any P0
  or P1 finding and its only documented exit is an operator override with a recorded rationale:
  a question, in a background tab, waiting forever, after an hour of build work. The observed run
  came back clean and so survived it.

  A `work` unit is now told to skip that gate, but **only when the run actually has a code-review
  phase of its own** — read off the unit table, in any vendor's spelling. Without one, the in-loop
  gate is the only review there is, and suppressing it would remove the review rather than move it.

### Added

- Tests covering what a dispatched saga unit is actually told: vendor spelling, the two
  backend notes, and the new review-elsewhere note including the case where it must not fire.


## [1.8.0] - 2026-08-16

### Fixed

- **The planner is told the backend too, not just the builder.** 1.7.0 told `/work`, but `/plan`
  §5.2 offers the backend as well — so under orchestration the planner would hang before the builder
  was ever reached. Both stages now get a note, and they differ because the jobs differ: `/plan` is
  told to record `backend:` in the plan's frontmatter, `/work` is told the plan already says so.
  Together with saga's matching change, the decision now travels on the committed document rather
  than in an untracked saga tick that never crosses a worktree boundary.


## [1.7.0] - 2026-08-16

### Fixed

- **A `/work` unit no longer stops to ask which execution backend to use.** Saga's `/work` offers the
  backend unconditionally — its contract has no skip-if-already-decided path — and an
  `AskUserQuestion` in a background tab waits forever. It was caught only because the operator
  happened to be watching that tab; unattended, the unit would hang.

  The backend is a property of the run, not of a unit, so it is decided up front: the plan carries
  `"backend": "inline"` and orchestrate appends the decision to every saga `work` task when it
  sends. Always inline — a dispatched unit is already one of several parallel sessions, and nesting
  a workflow inside one is the orchestration-of-orchestration this plugin exists to avoid.

  Unlike saga's engine offer there is no stored preference to pre-seed, and the archived
  implementation never handled this either, so the task text is the only lever saga exposes today.
  The durable fix belongs in saga: `/work` should honour an already-recorded
  `orchestration_operator_choice` instead of re-offering.


## [1.6.0] - 2026-08-16

### Added

- **`~/.config/orchestrate/models.json` — the models the operator actually uses.** A vendor's model
  list is a fact worth asking for; deciding which of them matters is a preference, and a preference
  belongs in a file the operator owns. opencode alone fronts 164 models across eight providers, so
  offering four of them is noise — and it was wrong three rounds running. `roster --models` now
  leads with the favourites and shows the vendor's full list beneath. Absent or unreadable, nothing
  changes: it is a convenience, never a constraint, and a model not listed is still usable.

### Fixed

- **Model listing no longer times out inconsistently.** `agy models` can take most of a minute on a
  cold start, and the 20-second bound made it report "cannot list its models" on one run and
  enumerate them on the next. An answer that changes run to run is worse than a slow one for a
  command the operator invoked deliberately.


## [1.5.1] - 2026-08-16

### Fixed

- **The saga command is translated per vendor when it is sent, not left to the interview.** 1.5.0
  documented that codex takes `$saga:plan` and grok, qwen and opencode take `/plan`, then relied on
  the interview to render each unit's task correctly. It did not: a live run dispatched `/saga:plan`
  — claude's form — to a codex unit, which reads it as prose and does something of its own. Silent,
  like every other wrong-prefix failure here. `normalize_task` now rewrites an explicitly namespaced
  saga command into the receiving vendor's form at the moment of sending, so the interview writes
  `/saga:<cap>` once for everybody and cannot get it wrong.

  Only an explicitly namespaced command (`/saga:x` or `$saga:x`) is rewritten. Plain prose, file
  paths and bare slash commands are left exactly alone — guessing at what is and is not a command is
  how this goes wrong in the other direction.

### Added

- **Whether a vendor has saga at all is now resolved from disk, not believed.** `saga <cap>` locates
  each vendor's install and reports what it finds: claude under its plugin cache, codex as skills
  with no commands directory, grok in its marketplace cache, qwen as an extension, opencode as flat
  command files. **agy and muse have no saga install** — only a stale backup in agy's case — so a
  saga task sent to either does nothing whatever prefix it carries. That was invisible before.
- **`start` and `expand` refuse a saga task aimed at a vendor without saga**, naming the unit and
  the vendor, before a tab opens. The prefix was never the only way this failed.


## [1.5.0] - 2026-08-16

### Changed

- **A run now has a shared branch, and units land on it — the way a team uses a feature branch.**
  Previously each unit branched from its predecessor's branch, so a reviewer read the planner's
  branch directly. When the planner committed nothing, the reviewer opened on an empty tree, found
  no plan, and wrote a confident review of a document that had never existed. Now `start` creates
  `orch/<run-id>`, every unit branches from it, `land` merges finished units back onto it between
  phases, and `collect` merges that one branch home at the end. A reviewer sees a plan because the
  plan was landed, not because it guessed which branch to read.
- **`land` names any unit that finished without committing.** That is the failure worth surfacing —
  not a missing merge, but a session that produced nothing and reported itself done.

### Fixed

- **Untracked files no longer block `land` or `collect`.** The dirty-tree check counted untracked
  files, and `.orchestrate/` is untracked in every real repository, so both would have refused on
  every run. Only tracked modifications block a merge.
- **Unit branches are `orch/<run>-<unit>`, not `orch/<run>/<unit>`.** Git cannot hold both
  `orch/<run>` and `orch/<run>/<unit>` as branches — one ref would have to be a file and a directory
  at once, and worktree creation failed outright.
- **A unit still will not run against a dependency that produced nothing**, as a backstop. A dependent unit opens on
  its dependency's branch; if that branch is still at the base commit there is nothing to work on.
  Launching anyway does not fail loudly — the session finds no plan, no diff, no artifact, and
  writes something plausible about nothing. That happened: a doc-review unit on grok reviewed a plan
  document that had never been written, and produced a confident review of it. `go` now checks each
  dependency for commits and skips the unit with a plain reason instead of opening that tab.

### Changed

- **`wait` is told by herdr instead of asking it.** Salvaged `herdr_events.py` from the archived
  implementation: a newline-delimited JSON client for herdr's event socket, subscribing to
  `pane.agent_status_changed` and blocking in the kernel until a line arrives. Two pieces of
  protocol knowledge came with the salvage and are the reason it was not rewritten from the schema —
  subscriptions use the dotted vocabulary rather than the underscored broadcast names, and the
  first line back is a `subscription_started` handshake that must not be read as an event.
  A third was found by testing against the live socket: **subscriptions are per pane**, so a request
  without `pane_id` is rejected outright. Units therefore record their `pane_id` at launch.
  Dropped from the salvage as unneeded here: reconnect-with-catch-up, threading, and connection
  accounting. `herdr agent wait` remains as the fallback when the socket is unreachable.


## [1.4.0] - 2026-08-16

Round four, from the first run that reached dispatch. Two competing plans were produced at xhigh
over twelve minutes and both were lost.

### Fixed

- **Units could not write the worktree they were given.** Orchestrate passed no permission flag, so
  every unit ran at its vendor's default: codex answered "I can't write", claude sat in plan mode.
  Zero commits from either planner; both plans existed only as terminal scrollback. Each vendor is
  now launched with a permission level: `auto` by default — enough to get on with its own work
  without stopping to ask — and `bypass` per unit for a free hand. All seven vendors are covered,
  not just claude and codex; claude and grok turn out to share the same mode vocabulary. The
  worktree is the blast radius either way.
- **A bare `/plan` is a command nowhere.** Saga is installed for every vendor but invoked
  differently: `/saga:plan` for claude, `$saga:plan` for codex, `/plan` for grok, qwen and opencode.
  Sent bare it arrives as prose and the agent does something of its own — which is how a `/plan`
  unit produced claude's built-in plan mode. `orchestrate.py saga <cap>` renders the right form.

### Added

- **Unit names are descriptive.** `plan-claude`, not `p1a` — the name becomes the herdr tab title,
  the branch and the worktree directory, and it is what the operator reads in a screen of tabs.
- **`wait` — block until a running unit settles, driven by herdr's events rather than polling.**
  `herdr agent wait` is level-triggered: it returns at once if the agent has already settled
  (measured at 0.010s) and otherwise blocks inside the server. So there is no race between checking
  and waiting, and no loop burning cycles. Replaces the previous advice to watch with a poll loop.
- **`clean --merged` — close only units whose branch is already in the tree.** That is the one case
  where closing is free: the work is in HEAD, so the tab and worktree are pure overhead. Everything
  unmerged is kept, because its worktree is the evidence you look at when a unit went wrong.


## [1.3.0] - 2026-08-16

Round three of live operator use. Every vendor can now be given a tier, and the vendor list means
what it says.

### Fixed

- **The tier flag table was stale in four places, silently.** `claude` grew `--effort` and was being
  launched with no effort control at all — as the default planner. `agy` and `muse` were absent
  entirely despite both taking `--model` and an effort flag. Read from each tool's own `--help`.
- **`roster` is now `known vendors ∩ available here`, not everything the wrapper lists.** Orchestrate
  has to know how to drive a vendor before offering it, so Hermes profiles and provider variants are
  reported separately rather than presented as choices. Both halves of the intersection matter: a
  vendor this plugin understands is useless on a machine without it.

### Added

- **`roster --models` asks each vendor which models it actually has.** Model names were the last
  thing still taken from memory — the same source that got the crew list and the flag table wrong.
  `grok` and `opencode` can answer; `claude` documents its aliases in its own help; the rest cannot,
  and for those the operator supplies the name rather than anyone guessing. Bounded by a timeout,
  because `agy models` can hang and a frozen interview is the failure this plugin keeps fixing.
- **Notes on an interview answer are instructions.** "Use grok for the second plan instead of codex"
  is applied and carried into the table, and beats the option it was attached to. The table is
  edited in plain language and redrawn in full, so what is approved is what runs.
- **`setup` on a unit — slash commands sent into the session before its task.** `["/effort high"]`
  for a vendor whose command line has no effort flag. Every vendor can therefore be given a model
  and an effort: through the command line where one exists, through the session where one does not.
  No vendor is presented as untierable.
- **`roster --probe` compares the flag table against each tool's own help and reports drift.** It
  tests the token orchestrate actually passes, so codex's `-c model_reasoning_effort=` config
  override is not mistaken for a missing flag. This check caught a regression in the same change
  that introduced it: `opencode` really does take `-m/--model` on its interactive session, and had
  been wrongly removed.


## [1.2.0] - 2026-08-16

Round two of live operator use. Three corrections, all from watching the interview run.

### Added

- **`roster` — the agents this machine can launch, asked of the wrapper every time.** Reads the
  `Tools:` section of `agents --help`. The interview was using `agents --crews`, which is the
  operator's own saved workspace layout and has nothing to do with orchestration: it offered three
  agents when seventeen were available, silently dropping qwen and every other installed agent. That
  was a quiet wrong answer, so it is now code rather than an instruction.
- **`start` and `expand` refuse a unit naming an agent the wrapper cannot launch**, so a typo fails
  before any worktree exists rather than as a per-unit launch failure afterwards.

### Changed

- **A review phase is a panel, not a seat.** The interview asked which single vendor would do
  doc-review and which would do code-review. It now asks how many reviewers a phase gets and turns
  each into its own unit, tab, worktree and vendor — three reviewers is three rows. The count is a
  default for unattended runs; the operator re-confirms the actual rows at the expansion gate, in
  the session they are actually watching.
- **`engine_prefs` defaults to `none` for review stages.** The panel is orchestrate's job; letting
  each panel member also take a saga second opinion doubles the sessions without being asked. The
  stored answer still does its real job of stopping a dispatched tab hanging on the offer.
- **No remembered vendor opinions in the interview.** It volunteered that a vendor had gone idle in
  unrelated work — not checkable from the repository in front of it, not asked for, and it steers a
  choice that belongs to the operator. Vendor commentary is now limited to what `roster` reports.

## [1.1.1] - 2026-08-16

### Fixed

- **The agent-session wrapper is `agents`, not `agent`.** The operator renamed it because `agent`
  now belongs to another tool on the machine. Orchestrate hardcoded the old name in `agent_argv`,
  and the failure would not have been a missing command — it would have launched the other tool with
  flags it has never heard of. The name is now resolved and checked before use, overridable with
  `ORCHESTRATE_AGENT_LAUNCHER`, and a wrapper that is not on `PATH` produces one clear sentence
  instead of a confusing wrong-program run. `agents --crews` corrected in the command and the skill.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-08-16

### Added

- **`expand` — append units to a run already in flight.** The up-front table can only name the later
  phases, never their units: what `/work` splits into is decided by the plan, which does not exist
  when the operator approves. A phase that names the next phase's units is now read when it
  finishes, the operator approves those rows alone, and they join the same run — so `after` still
  reaches back and one `collect` covers everything. Refuses a duplicate name or a dependency that is
  in no run.
- **`engine_prefs` — saga's external-engine offer, answered before dispatch.** A `/doc-review` or
  `/code-review` session with nothing stored stops and asks the operator, in a background tab nobody
  is watching, and waits forever. The plan's `engine_prefs` block is now written to
  `<worktree>/.saga/engine-prefs.json` when the worktree is made; saga reads it and skips the
  question. Verified end to end against saga's own `engine_offer.py`, which returns
  `prompt_required=False, source=stored` for a worktree orchestrate prepared.

### Changed

- **The interview asks at the right layer.** Vendors are chosen once for the whole orchestration as
  an allow-list, not one per unit. `/plan` is asked whether it wants competing independent plans
  from several vendors, which this session then merges itself rather than dispatching a merge unit.
  The reviews are asked once for their second-opinion policy, applied across every lifecycle.
  `/work` and `/code-review` are asked nothing — their vendors and lenses come from the plan.
- **Every question carries a recommendation**, and a declined question no longer stalls the run: the
  command takes the most defensible answer, says which it took, and continues to the table, which is
  the real gate and fully editable.
- **The command documents the layering** — orchestration, lifecycle, phase, unit — so a parent issue
  with children reads as one lifecycle per child rather than one flat list.

## [1.0.1] - 2026-08-16

### Fixed

- **The command told the session to run a script path that only exists in this repo.** Both
  `commands/orchestrate.md` and the skill printed
  `S=plugins/orchestrate/skills/orchestrate/scripts/orchestrate.py`, which resolves only when the
  operator happens to be inside `infiquetra-claude-plugins`. `/orchestrate` is for running work in
  *other* repositories, so every real use would have failed at dispatch with a missing file. Both
  documents now resolve the installed script through `$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT`, falling back to the
  plugin cache.
- **`uv run python` required the operator's repository to be a uv project.** The script imports
  nothing outside the standard library, so both documents now call `python3` directly.

Found by the first real operator run, against issue 48 of `campps-e2e-canary`, before it reached
dispatch.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-08-16

### Changed

- **`/orchestrate` exists.** The command reads a prompt, an issue, a parent issue's children, or a
  document; interviews the operator for what it cannot infer; and hands back an editable table of
  unit, saga capability, agent, model, effort and dependency. Nothing launches until that table is
  approved.
- Each unit runs in its own git worktree and branch, in its own herdr session, with any agent
  configured on the machine. A unit with dependencies branches from the last one it names, so a
  `/work` unit opens on top of its `/plan` unit's output.
- State is a single `.orchestrate/run.json`.

### Removed

- The durable register with column ownership, per-column writers and generation locks; the
  completion evidence gate; the mirror worker; admission slot reservations; the consensus panel and
  bounded review loop; token accounting and spend ceilings; and the composed runner's crash
  reconciliation and claim transactions — 14,875 lines of production code and roughly 15,700 lines
  of tests.
- None of it defended against a failure that can happen to one operator on one machine. The full
  implementation is preserved on `origin` at `archive/orchestrate-full-implementation`, so any
  individual piece can be pulled back if a real run ever justifies it.

### Notes

- qwen does not report interactive readiness, so `herdr agent prompt` refuses it; the dispatcher
  falls back to typing into the session's pane.

## [0.13.0] - 2026-08-16

### Changed

- The durable register keeps authored intent and outcomes only. Where a child is running -- its
  pane, tab, working directory, process id, observed state and vendor -- is no longer copied into
  columns that cannot know when the world moved on. One named function per question asks the
  terminal control plane at the moment the answer is used, with no cache and no per-read facts
  object behind it.
- A complete answer that contains the thing, a complete answer that contains nothing, and a query
  that could not be completed are three distinct outcomes, and only the third fails closed. A
  failed, partial, ambiguous or malformed query raises; it never degrades into an empty answer.
- Launch recovery resolves through the same complete-snapshot parser as every other reader, so a
  partial answer can no longer be read as "no session exists" and start a second live session for
  work already running.
- An admission slot held by an expired owner is reclaimed on confirmed absence, retained on
  confirmed presence, and left untouched when the query fails, so the concurrency limit no longer
  ratchets in one direction until the process restarts.
- The subscriber considers a row for its owner-missing signal only when a snapshot could place that
  row, so an unrelated tab closing on the host no longer wakes the orchestrator.
- A register file written before this change is normalised on read and rewritten in the new shape on
  its next ordinary write.

### Removed

- The seven live-session columns, from the schema and from every writer. A guard walks every
  module's syntax tree rather than naming the writers that exist today.

## [0.12.1] - 2026-08-16

### Fixed

- Vendor identity comparisons now normalise compatibility forms, remove Unicode format characters,
  collapse whitespace, and fold case. Cross-script confusables remain distinct because vendor names
  are trusted caller input, not text from which identity is inferred.
- Every unusable answer is recorded in the panel outcome, including excluded, unknown, duplicate,
  wrong-type, and unidentifiable answers. Invalid answers halt a panel without discarding blocking
  evidence already returned by a voting seat.
- A plan rigor report no longer calls composed edits applied when their net result is byte-identical
  to the reviewed plan. Those edits return as recommended remainders instead.

## [0.12.0] - 2026-08-16

### Added

- A consensus panel whose roster excludes the unit builder's vendor. An external-only roster also
  excludes the home vendor. The decision boundary rebuilds the layer policy and immutable
  denominator, then checks roster self-consistency against the identities the roster declares.
- One independent vendor per voting seat, explicit configuration-to-roster layer linkage, and panel
  outcomes that retain structural exclusions and name malformed responses.
- Asymmetric panel authority: one blocking gate rank halts, while proceeding requires a complete,
  non-blocking response from every constructed voting seat. Missing seats never shrink the
  denominator, an under-strength roster cannot satisfy its original quorum, and malformed responses
  cannot discard blocking evidence returned by another seat.
- Per-dimension instruments. Gate dimensions use a blocking rank and refuse numeric thresholds;
  score dimensions use a numeric convergence threshold and refuse ranks. Scores report convergence
  without deciding whether work proceeds. Every enabled panel includes a gate, every score is paired
  with its seat, and an empty score series never reports convergence.
- A single-voter rigor pass for orchestration plans. It atomically applies evidence-backed edits
  whose anchors are unique in the reviewed bytes and do not overlap. It preserves unrelated line
  endings, records each replacement, refuses symlinks and stale digests, and hands ambiguous or
  judgment-dependent findings to the operator. Its slotted report type has no decision field.

## [0.11.1] - 2026-08-16

### Fixed

- The last allowed iteration escalates for a recurring class, an earlier class that remains
  undisposed, an explicitly blocking finding, or an unperformed review. New non-blocking findings
  close the review without escalation.
- Blocking is a required keyword-only boolean on each finding. The loop does not infer it from the
  finding's free-form rank.
- Every verdict produced from a performed report returns that report's findings, including findings
  filed when the last allowed iteration closes.

## [0.11.0] - 2026-08-15

### Added

- A bounded review loop for the orchestration lifecycle. At most three iterations per unit over its
  lifetime, a re-review scoped to the change since the previous iteration, recurrence tracked by a
  defect class the reviewer declares rather than one inferred from prose, and three verdicts:
  `pass`, `halt-and-repair`, `halt-and-escalate`.
- Findings still open on the last allowed iteration escalate mechanically, regardless of the rank
  they carry. There is no remaining iteration in which to repair, so instructing a caller to repair
  would be untrue whether the class is new or recurring.
- Resolution must be authored. A report carries the classes it disposes of, and `pass` is refused
  while a class raised in an earlier iteration is still open, so a reviewer's silence about an
  unchanged path is no longer read as a fix. Disposing a class that was never open is refused, as is
  disposing and re-raising one class in the same report.
- A review that could not be performed is recorded separately from one that found nothing, emits no
  verdict, does not consume the iteration, and has an explicit conclusion that is never `pass`.
- Unit identifiers and defect classes are canonicalised once at a single site each, so surrounding
  whitespace can no longer split one unit into two or hide a recurring class.

## [0.10.0] - 2026-08-15

### Fixed

- An unparseable usage line marks the row and returns. The spend gate refuses,
  and a later parseable sample does not clear the mark. An ordinary output
  line containing the word token no longer kills the subscriber that holds
  the run's event stream.
- A completion verdict and the phase it justifies are one register write. A
  reap records `reaped` and `expected_state=exited` as one write.
- A writer-less upsert of `agent` cannot change what the run is charged.
  Spend excludes supervising rows by the owned `role` column, not by
  matching an `agent` name. `tokens_reserved` is owned by admission's write
  gateway, so a writer-less upsert cannot lower the charge.
- The mirror's owned-column seam names the `role` writer on the same write
  that records the rest of the mirror identity. The column stays owned; the
  identity stays one write.

## [0.9.3] - 2026-08-15

### Fixed

- An owned register column arriving at the generic merger without that
  column's writer is refused. Production writers of `phase` and
  `observed_state` go through the named setters. The reservation record is
  owned by the admission write gateway, not by reserve alone.
- Equal delta usage lines add. A content hash is not a delivery identity.
  A line matching both usage grammars is refused. Unparseable telemetry
  after a prior sample fails the spend gate closed.
- `commit_plan` writes the reservation, generation, phase, and plan row
  under one admission-then-generation critical section. Retirement takes
  the admission lock first, so it cannot split a reserved verdict from its
  reservation.
- A child is charged zero only when its phase is `planned`. A missing
  phase is unknown and fails closed.
- The generation sidecar is written atomically under the generation lock.
  An empty or unreadable sidecar is absent; a generation already stamped
  on the register is restored rather than minting a second one.

## [0.9.2] - 2026-08-15

### Fixed

- Shared register columns name one writer. `phase="planned"` cannot replace a
  terminal phase. `artifact_path` is written only when the artifact is settled.
  Admission writes only the row fields it owns.
- Re-planning a finished child is refused, including when its reservation is
  still held. `activate_slot` refuses a terminal row.
- An inferred snapshot absence is not immediate death. Reclaim of a held slot
  still requires a directly observed exit, an expired holder lease, or a
  terminal phase.
- A silent vendor is charged its declared `tokens_max` once launched. An
  observed value cannot lower that ceiling.
- `commit_plan` no longer accepts per-call limits the rendered plan does not
  own. The durable host policy must still equal the bounds the operator was
  shown. The presentation receipt is bound to a generation and is forgotten
  with the register.
- Queue promotion takes the globally oldest eligible entry by enqueue time.

### Changed

- A planned or queued child has spent zero. A launched metered child with no
  telemetry still fails closed.
- Usage replay is deduplicated by event identity. Cumulative totals keep a
  monotonic maximum; input/output samples add.
- Child `scope` is a sequence of bounded repository-relative paths.
  `tokens_max` is an exact positive integer.
- An absent host policy file still defaults. Every other unreadable or
  malformed file is an admission error that names the path.

## [0.9.1] - 2026-08-14

### Fixed

- Admission owns reservations, the queue, and the host policy. It no longer
  writes `phase`. Occupancy for the bound is the reservation set on every live
  run. Active phases without a reservation are evidence, not enforcement.
- A queued child that has already finished is dropped from the queue rather
  than promoted back to `planned`.
- Host bounds count every live run. An optional `admission.policy` file is
  the durable operator-set rule; reserve never writes it. Absent file means
  the documented defaults. A write still binds a run to its own stored work
  location.
- Reusing a row id for a different vendor or shape is a refusal.
- A planned reservation is not reclaimed because it has no pane yet. An
  observed `exited` holder is reclaimable even if the pane id remains.
- Every planned child declares a positive `tokens_max`. A silent vendor is
  charged that declaration, not an unlabeled estimate. The run-level spend
  gate no longer skips an unaccounted child.
- `commit_plan` requires a presentation receipt whose digest matches the
  rendered plan, which now includes scope, artifact, predicate, and
  integration mode.
- Observed-token writes hold the generation lock across read and write. A
  redelivered usage line is not counted twice. `context left` and token rates
  are not spend.

## [0.9.0] - 2026-08-14

### Added

- Planning decides the split and the route and then stops. `planning.py` never
  imports or calls `launch_child`. The operator is shown the plan before
  `commit_plan` writes a reservation. A plan that has not been presented is
  refused.
- Routing maps a work shape through `tier_policy.json` and the shared tier
  resolver's `resolve_for_runtime`. An unavailable preferred vendor walks
  `claude`, `codex`, `grok`, `qwen`, `muse`, `agy` and records the
  substitution. An explicit operator vendor, model, or effort is recorded as
  an override. See `references/routing.md`.
- Register-owned admission: per-vendor and aggregate work-in-progress bounds,
  a durable FIFO queue at the document root, an atomic reservation under a
  host-wide admission lock taken before the per-run generation lock, a
  release that advances the queue, and reclaim of a dead holder's slot.
  Exceeding a per-vendor bound queues even when aggregate room remains.
- Spend accounting. `tokens_reserved` is produced by `reserve_slot` and
  consumed by `check_spend` when the vendor has no usage line. `tokens_observed`
  is produced from a `pane.output_matched` usage line (the subscriber is the
  writer) and consumed by `check_spend` when the vendor reports usage. Missing
  telemetry fails closed. `authorize_spend` is never passed `None` to mean a
  silent vendor.
- `canonical_work_location` bounds the git subprocess at five seconds. A
  timeout, a missing git, or a non-repository is `intended.resolve()`, not the
  nearest existing ancestor. Two missing siblings of one parent no longer
  compare equal.
## [0.8.0] - 2026-08-15

### Fixed

- **The scanner's bounds now have exactly one way to end, and it is the honest one.** The
  structure walk returned a bare "not found" when it hit its depth limit, and the caller could
  not tell that answer from "no declaration present" — so a nine-level JSON object whose
  innermost `argv` was bound to a proper sequence was accepted, with the scan reporting that it
  had finished cleanly. Depth 7 refused; depth 9 did not.

  This was the third appearance of one shape, once per review round, each with a different
  constant: a decode budget reported clean on exhaustion, then a line sweep did, then the walk
  did. Each was repaired alone while the next one waited. The repair this time is structural
  rather than another remembered rule — every bound (walk depth, walk size, encoding layers,
  decoded bytes, embedded regions) is consumed through a single budget object, and the scan
  builds its one and only result from that budget at a single return point. A bound cannot be
  reached and reported as a clean scan because there is no second place where completeness is
  decided, and a test asserts that single decision point structurally.

- **Three bounds were refusing the reading work the mirror exists to do.** A 201-line
  comparison of two children's reports — the example this unit uses for work that must leave the
  operator's channel — was refused as unexaminable. So was a one-line question naming seventeen
  `*args`-style identifiers, and thirty-three short Base64 notes. Fail-closed is right; failing
  closed at a threshold ordinary prose crosses is a defect in the same way an accepted
  declaration is.

  The line cap is gone: parsing every line of a worst-case instruction at the byte cap measures
  0.083s, so the byte cap was already the real bound. The decoded-payload cap is now measured in
  bytes rather than in a count of payloads, because a count is not a measure of work. The walk
  depth is raised well above anything a real document reaches, which it can be safely now that
  reaching it refuses.

- **Alias amplification is bounded by the walk, not by counting alias-looking text.** The
  previous guard counted `*name` occurrences, which fired on Python `*args` and markdown
  `*emphasis*` — shapes this repository's own source produces dozens of times per file — and did
  not recognise YAML's numeric aliases (`*1`) at all. A 424-byte document using numeric anchors
  took over nine seconds to scan. The structure walk now visits each shared node once, which
  brings the same document under three milliseconds and makes the count unnecessary; the guard
  that was not protecting anything has been removed rather than tuned.

- **A declaration after a `---` separator was parsed by nothing.** `yaml.safe_load` returns
  only the first document of a multi-document stream, so a second or third document was never
  examined while the scan reported that it had finished — the same shape as the bounds above,
  in a loader rather than a budget. Every document in the stream is now loaded. Found by this
  unit's own adversarial pass rather than by a review.

- **A Python mapping whose `argv` is a tuple, written after a prose prefix, reached the pane.**
  `Run this: {'argv': ('uv', 'run', 'pytest', '-q')}` is not valid YAML, is not the whole text,
  and the textual fallback does not recognise `(`. Balanced `{...}` and `[...]` regions are now
  parsed individually, so the declaration is found by a loader. Locating the region is textual;
  deciding what it means is not.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-08-15

### Changed

- **The predicate detector parses and inspects the result; it no longer pattern-matches
  serialized text.** Matching text was unsound and imprecise at the same time, for one reason.
  YAML can bind the exact key `argv` without those four letters ever standing next to a
  separator — through an escape, or through an anchor and an alias — so a text detector missed
  real declarations. The same pattern fired on `sys.argv:` in an ordinary sentence, so it
  refused requests to read this repository's own source, which is the mirror's whole job.
  Parsing closes both directions with one change: after a safe parse an escaped key **is**
  `argv` and an alias-bound key **is** `argv`, and a sentence mentioning `argv` does not parse
  into a mapping with an `argv` key at all.

  The detector now unwraps Base64 and hexadecimal runs — repeatedly, until they stop decoding,
  so layered wrapping is followed rather than capped — resolves `\uXXXX` escapes, and parses
  under `json`, `yaml.safe_load`, `tomllib`, and `ast.literal_eval`, applying each to the whole
  text, to each individual line, and to string leaves inside a parsed structure. It refuses
  when a result is **a mapping with an `argv` key bound to a sequence**, which is the predicate
  schema's own shape: `PredicateSpec` rejects an `argv` that is a command string, so binding
  the rule to the schema is what lets a type annotation (`argv: list[str]`, an `argv` bound to
  a *string*) survive.

  Every loader is a safe loader — `yaml.safe_load`, never `yaml.load` — because a parser that
  executed untrusted input would be a worse defect than the one being fixed. Alias expansion is
  the one resource risk a safe loader still carries, so text carrying an unusual number of YAML
  aliases is refused as unexaminable rather than expanded. A textual fallback remains for
  material no loader can parse at all, and is documented as a heuristic rather than the
  guarantee.
  *The alias count is superseded in 0.8.0: it counted a text shape this repository's own source
  produces and missed YAML's numeric aliases entirely. A memoised walk bounds the amplification
  instead.*

  Refused now and not before: a YAML escaped key, a YAML anchor and alias, layered Base64, and
  hexadecimal. Accepted now and not before: `argv = permission_argv(runtime)`,
  `argv: list[str]`, `sys.argv:`, `def main(*argv: str)`, an annotation block, and a list of
  seventeen commit identifiers. A mirror that refuses ordinary synthesis is as broken as one
  that accepts a predicate.

- **Every published claim now states the same boundary.** The reference, this changelog, the
  skill page, the module docstring and the test names had drifted apart: the docstring
  disclosed an encoding depth limit while four other places said Base64 was caught. The
  contract is now written in two halves in `references/operator-channel.md` — what is
  mechanically refused (machine-readable declarations), what is not detectable (an English
  request, for which no general detector is achievable), and what makes the undetectable case
  survivable (a mirror opinion cannot become `verified`, because completion requires a dispatch
  receipt the mirror is never issued).

- **The skill page no longer says nothing distinguishes a thinking mirror from a dead one.**
  That sentence was retracted in 0.6.0 and survived in one place fifteen lines from its own
  correction.

### Fixed

- **The first look at a pane's revision counter no longer advances the clock.** A counter is
  only evidence of emission when there is a previous one to compare it against, so the first
  observation now records a baseline and leaves the reference where it was. Treating it as an
  advance let a supervision loop that started late report a long-dead mirror as `working` with
  the pane-revision feed named as the source — health the counter had not established. It
  delayed a hang rather than suppressing one, but it made calling the reader strictly worse
  than not calling it, because the dispatch clock would already have tripped.
- **A revision counter that goes backwards re-baselines instead of sticking.** A herdr
  reconnect restarts the series; previously a decrease wrote nothing at all, so real output
  stayed invisible until the new series climbed past the old maximum. The safe direction is
  kept — a restarted counter is not evidence of emission — while letting the feed recover.
- **A failed subscription acknowledgement retracts the previous one.** The acknowledgement is
  durable and the subscriber process is not, so a replacement subscriber could inherit a dead
  process's confirmation, turning the distinct missing-wire state back into a working-or-hung
  report. A caller presenting a list without the mirror's subscription is evidence the wire is
  gone, and is now treated as such.
- **A request to summarise commit identifiers is no longer refused.** Base64 candidates were
  counted before being decoded, so seventeen hexadecimal identifiers exhausted a budget and the
  scan reported itself incomplete. Only runs that decode to valid UTF-8 are payloads now.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-08-15

### Changed

- **A published guarantee was false and is now accurate.** The mirror's documentation stated
  that a predicate never reaches it. A predicate did reach it, three ways, and the claim has
  been narrowed to what the mechanism actually does while the mechanism itself has been made as
  strong as it honestly can be. The honest sentence is that the mirror is never *asked* for a
  verdict through this API. An instruction that describes a check in ordinary English is not
  detectable by any scanner, and the live agent beyond the pane is itself a program executor.
  Column ownership was previously offered as the containment for this and does not contain it:
  it stops a mirror's opinion becoming a `verified` row, not a claimed verdict being produced,
  and a claimed verdict with no second reader is the failure the requirement names.
- **Hang detection can now tell a thinking mirror from a dead one, and the earlier claim that
  nothing could was too strong.** The subscriber advances `last_event_at` only on a matched
  sentinel and the mirror's only subscribed sentinel is its return marker, so that feed alone
  makes the clock a per-request tolerance. `observe_pane_activity` reads herdr's pane-output
  `revision` counter from a `session.snapshot` — the feed the register names for this, naming
  this unit as its reader — and records it on the mirror's own row, so a pane still emitting
  keeps the clock fed and a pane that has stopped lets it trip. It is a snapshot read rather
  than a heartbeat subscription because the subscriber wakes the orchestrator on every handled
  event, so a heartbeat would wake the operator's channel on a timer. `MirrorLiveness` now
  reports which feed the answer rested on, so "working" from a stale clock and "working" from a
  live one are not the same word.

### Fixed

- **The predicate-declaration scan keys on the declaration's signature, not on one
  serialisation.** A predicate is the name `argv` bound to a value; JSON, a YAML block or flow
  mapping, TOML, a Python literal, a string nested inside another object, unicode-escaped
  braces, and Base64 are the same declaration in different clothes, and all are refused.
  Enumerating serialisations is a race the enumerator loses.
  *Superseded in 0.7.0, which replaces text matching with parsing — see that entry for why
  matching a signature in serialized text was still both unsound and imprecise.*
- **The scan fails closed.** An instruction it cannot finish examining within its budget is
  refused rather than passed. Reporting "clean" on exhaustion had turned a denial-of-service
  bound into the bypass: a real declaration parked behind 512 decoy braces was never inspected
  and was accepted, while 511 decoys were correctly refused.
- **Dispatch re-runs the request's checks on the object it is handed.** Every load-bearing
  check lived in a constructor while the one function that talks to the pane read attributes
  off whatever arrived, so any object with the right attribute names bypassed the closed kind
  vocabulary and the scan together. This closes the class rather than an instance of it.
- **Every clock input must be finite.** A NaN threshold passed validation because every ordered
  comparison with NaN is false, and positive infinity passed honestly; either made a dead
  mirror report `working` forever, reaching the affirmative state the unarmed error exists to
  prevent by a different door. Thresholds, dispatch instants, observed instants and the
  supplied `now` are all now required to be finite, and a non-finite threshold is refused at
  creation.
- **A zero or negative default return bound is refused at creation.** It is interpolated into
  the charter as the session's standing default, so zero told the mirror its default budget was
  nothing, which would make every return that honoured the charter oversized.

### Added

- **`resume_mirror` rebuilds a live session from the register alone.** The mirror's nonce and
  return markers previously existed only in an in-memory session object, so an orchestrator
  that died could not collect from a mirror that was still running — which contradicts the
  requirement that the mirror is persistent for the life of the orchestration. The row now
  carries them, and the identity is written before the launch side effect alongside the row
  itself. The run's single mirror is located by its `role` column when no row id is given, and
  two mirrors in one run are refused rather than guessed.
- **A missing subscriber wire is loud instead of silent.** The mirror's row records the
  `pane.output_matched` subscription its returns require. `acknowledge_subscription` compares
  it against the list the subscriber was actually given and refuses a mismatch; until something
  confirms it, `check_liveness` raises a distinct unconfirmed-subscription error rather than
  reporting a state. A mirror nobody is listening to and a hung mirror produce identical
  silence, and reporting the first as the second sends the operator hunting a hang that is not
  there.
- **Repository-visible change over a request window is observed and recorded.** The mirror is
  read-only by contract and nothing prevents it writing — `mutating=False` keeps it in the
  ambient checkout but is not a write fence, and because the mirror declares no artifact it
  never reaches the post-hoc scope check, so a violation was previously not merely unprevented
  but unobserved. The observation is reported on the return and recorded durably; escalation is
  opt-in through `assert_no_repository_change`, because this session reads the operator's live
  working tree, so the operator's own edit lands in the same window and attribution is not
  established. Isolation was rejected deliberately: a worktree would give the mirror a tree
  nobody is working in.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-08-15

### Added

- **The mirror**: a persistent paired session that performs the orchestrator's own work —
  synthesis, comparison, bulk reading — so the operator's channel stays answerable while work
  happens. Children do the outcome's work; the mirror does the orchestrator's. It is launched
  through the same session path as any child (dry-run preview, write-ahead label, trust-prompt
  check, nonce-bound readiness sentinel) and holds an ordinary register row, written **before**
  the launch side effect so a mirror whose launch failed is visible rather than absent.
- **A distilled return under an enforced byte bound.** A return larger than its request's
  declared bound is rejected whole rather than truncated, because a truncated return is an
  oversized one wearing the appearance of success. The rejection carries the byte count and
  never the material — an error that quoted the return would perform the absorption it reports
  — and it is recorded durably, so a rejection is distinguishable from a return that never
  happened. The bound a request may declare is itself capped at 16 KiB (default 4 KiB): this
  contract does not erode by being deleted, it erodes by being raised. A rejected return leaves
  the mirror ready and holding its context, so the cost is one round trip rather than the
  session.
- **The validity predicate never runs in the mirror.** Routing it there would turn verification
  back into a claim: the mirror reports a pass, the orchestrator never sees the bytes and cannot
  re-check, and the evidence-failure class reappears one layer up with no second reader. Three
  independent guards — a closed vocabulary of reading request kinds with deciding kinds refused
  by name; refusal of any instruction carrying a predicate declaration; and a module that
  contains no program-execution route and does not import the completion module. What no guard
  catches is an instruction that describes a check in prose; the containment for that is the
  written routing rule plus the fact that the mirror writes no `phase`, so its opinion cannot
  become a verified row.
- **Clock-based hang detection**, because nothing else reaches this failure. Every other failure
  in this system appears as a disagreement between two values; a hung mirror's expected and
  observed states agree perfectly, every child still looks healthy, and the operator's channel
  is dead. `check_liveness` therefore compares silence against the row's declared
  `max_quiet_seconds`, taking the current instant as an argument rather than reading the system
  clock. It reads and raises: it writes nothing, closes nothing, and demotes nothing, because
  what to do about a quiet mirror is a decision. A row with no declared tolerance raises a
  distinct "not armed" error rather than reporting health, and an idle mirror is never alarmed,
  because a mirror between requests is legitimately silent forever.
- **Non-blocking dispatch.** No subscription is held open, no pane is polled, and there is no
  timeout parameter. The outstanding request is durable before the line is sent, so a failed
  send leaves an armed clock rather than an idle-looking mirror. A second request while one is
  outstanding is refused explicitly with the outstanding id, never silently dropped.
- **Checkable column ownership.** Every register write in the mirror module passes through one
  seam that refuses, at runtime, any column outside `role`, `max_quiet_seconds`,
  `mirror_request` and `mirror_last_return`, and only on the mirror's own row. It does not write
  `artifact_path`, does not write `observed_state` (the subscriber owns that and rewrites it on
  every catch-up pass), and never promotes its own phase. The mirror row is identified by `role`
  rather than by `agent`, because `agent` carries the launcher's actual agent name for every
  launched row and a second writer of a shared column is a defect this codebase has paid for.
- **`references/operator-channel.md`**: the routing rule in writing. Work goes to the mirror by
  default; the exception list is five entries, each with the reason it is bounded by
  construction; anything not on the list goes to the mirror even when it looks trivial. It also
  states plainly what the clock does not establish — nothing distinguishes a mirror quiet
  because it is thinking from one quiet because it is dead, and the within-request heartbeat
  that would narrow the gap is deliberately not built, because the subscriber wakes the
  orchestrator on every matched event and a heartbeat would wake the operator's channel on a
  timer.
  *Half superseded in 0.6.0: the heartbeat reasoning holds, but pane revision does distinguish
  the two, and 0.6.0 builds that feed.*
- **Deliberate context management.** The mirror is persistent for prompt-cache benefit and
  continuity, and a mirror that has silently degraded is worse than no mirror because the
  orchestrator will still believe its answers. Its context is compacted or cleared on
  instruction, refused while a request is outstanding, and refused outright for runtimes whose
  context commands are not established here rather than guessed — an unrecognised slash command
  is a silent no-op that looks like a reset.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-08-13

### Added

- The live register is one JSON document per run, addressed by `run_id` in an
  orchestrator-owned host-local directory (default `~/.orchestrate/registers/<run_id>.json`,
  relocatable by `ORCHESTRATE_REGISTER_DIR`). A child cannot write it by working in its
  landing. A `run_id` is host-global: two callers that name the same id share one live
  document in one checkout. Two checkouts of one `run_id` are a collision. Every
  decision and mutation API requires `run_id`. `retire_run` forgets the per-run secret
  first, then archives the document into the recorded work location, then deletes the
  live file and the recorded-root sidecar, so a reused id is a new authentication
  identity. Sidecar create, key mint, key delete, and retirement share one per-run lock,
  so a concurrent mint cannot complete while retirement still holds it. Forgetting the
  key requires the coordinator-recorded work location, including when the live file is
  already gone. Both sides of a work-location comparison are canonicalized to the git
  top level. Claude and Muse have no
  workspace-write flag; mode `0600` does not exclude a child running as this account, so
  the seal does not defend that residual.
- Completion is the only path to `verified`. A child reaches it when its predicate's dependency
  closure is unchanged, its artifact was settled by the orchestrator's own rename, that artifact
  carries this dispatch's pre-established run binding, the predicate passes, the repository
  boundary is clean, the recorded destination has actually changed, and — for judgment-shaped work
  — a claimed independent verifier's depth sample is on record. A failure records a verdict when
  the landing belongs to the receipt's git repository; a landing in a different repository raises
  rather than records, because neither register is then a store this evaluation may write. A
  row's phase is `verified` if and only if its latest verdict is a pass: a first failure leaves
  the phase alone, and a failing re-evaluation demotes a previously verified row so the reap
  gate cannot consume a contradiction as a pass.
- The receipt binds **every input the verdict depends on**, not the labels that name the dispatch.
  The specification, landing, baseline and receipt arrive as four independent arguments. A landing
  that belongs to the receipt's git repository has its outcome recorded under the specification's
  row in that register; a landing that does not raises rather than records. So the run, row,
  landing, work shape, mutability, declared scope, base commit, ambient root and changed-paths
  baseline must all agree with the receipt before anything else is read. Otherwise a
  receipt issued for judgment work verified under a mechanical shape, which skips the depth gate
  entirely, and an out-of-scope write verified under a widened scope. `runtime`, `integration_mode`
  and `destination` are also compared, but as consistency fields rather than deciding inputs:
  evaluation reads them from the receipt, never from the supplied arguments, so a mismatch is a
  muddled caller rather than a substitution. `write_scope` is sealed and deliberately **not**
  compared — it is a pure function of inputs that are each compared individually, so a comparison
  against it could never be the check that catches anything.
- **The repository is derived, not supplied.** It is the work location the receipt binds —
  where git runs, where artifacts settle, where retirement archives — not the address of the
  live register. The live register is addressed by `run_id`. A caller who could name a
  second repository could still bind a landing in one tree to a receipt sealed for another;
  that is why issuance derives the work location from the landing and compares it to the
  recorded run root. The per-run secret does not cover this: it is named for the run alone
  and lives outside every repository, so it is shared by `run_id` on this host. R12 is
  one checkout: a second checkout cannot write the register. The secret is still shared,
  which is why it cannot stand in for a work-location check.
  Comparing a supplied root against the receipt was not enough, because the receipt's copy was made
  from that same supplied value at issue time — that catches a caller who changes it in between and
  cannot catch one that was wrong to begin with. So `issue_receipt` derives it from
  `landing.ambient_root`, refuses a landing that fails git identity or containment, and compares
  the derived store to the run root recorded at launch — a value whose provenance is not the
  landing. `evaluate_completion`, `settle_artifact` and `settlement_record` take it from the
  sealed receipt; none of the four accepts it as an argument. Git identity and containment are
  two properties: a nested repository shares ancestry and not identity; a sibling worktree
  shares identity and not ancestry. The live register is addressed by run id, not by working
  tree. Evaluation raises rather than records when the landing does not belong in the receipt's
  store.
  A landing that does not name its repository is refused rather than defaulted to its working
  directory. `read_receipt` is
  the one function that still takes a repository, because it is handed one with a row id and has no
  receipt yet — it checks the sealed root against the register it read, which is what stops an
  authentic verifier dispatch copied from another checkout of the same run from satisfying the
  depth gate here.
- The changed-paths baseline is bound by digest, because it is the one deciding input with no label:
  a baseline is repository state at an instant, and the same landing has different valid snapshots
  before and after a write, so binding the landing says nothing about when the snapshot was taken.
  Without it, an out-of-scope write verified against a baseline taken after the write. The snapshot
  is still produced once by the readiness path and passed in, rather than re-taken at issue, because
  two producers of one snapshot is the shape that hid a defect in the previous round.
- The predicate runs in its own process group, and the group is killed and waited out before the
  evidence is re-observed — on every exit path, success included. Waiting for the direct process
  only established that *that* process finished: a descendant outlived it, was reparented away, and
  rewrote the artifact after the snapshot that certified it, leaving a recorded pass whose durable
  digest did not match the file. A group that will not drain is `predicate_descendants`, a refusal.
  Group membership is the whole of that claim: a descendant that leaves the group with its own
  `setsid` is not reached by the kill, and `references/predicates.md` enumerates every actor the
  control does and does not cover.
- A `reaped` row keeps its terminal phase whichever way a later verdict goes. Demotion on a failing
  re-evaluation already worked; a *passing* re-evaluation wrote `verified` over `reaped`, and needed
  no forgery to do it — catch-up re-evaluates run-bound artifacts on startup and settlement replays
  cleanly, so a closed tab returned as a live verified child.
- The durable records the register holds are authenticated. The live file sits outside every
  landing, so a sandboxed child cannot rewrite it by address. Claude and Muse have no
  workspace-write flag, so the dispatch receipt and settlement record each carry a keyed
  digest under a per-run orchestrator secret held outside every landing. A digest that
  does not match this run's key authenticates against nothing and is refused. A
  same-account child that can read the key can produce a matching digest; the seal does
  not establish authorship against that residual. An added field is a mismatch rather
  than an ignored key, and a secret directory inside the repository is refused outright.
- Evaluation is safe to re-run for one dispatch. Settlement is recorded and replayed rather than
  re-attempted, which is what makes the restart path and judgment work reachable at all: the rename
  is one-shot, so without a record a second evaluation of a correct child fails as though it had
  written its destination directly.
- Predicates are a typed, closed schema: a fixed argument vector with a bounded timeout and output
  cap. Shell text, an `argv` string, a shell program, an inline-source flag, an unknown key, and an
  out-of-range limit are all rejected rather than clamped or ignored. The check runs inline in the
  orchestrator's process tree; a non-zero exit, a hang, an unlaunchable program, and output past
  the cap are each a failure and never a pass, with output streamed so an unbounded predicate is
  killed while still writing rather than buffered.
- A predicate cannot be weakened by the child it certifies. Its resolved import closure — not only
  its entry-point path — must lie outside everything the child may write, and a digest over that
  closure's contents is captured before dispatch and re-checked before evaluation, so a change to
  any statically known dependency fails even when that file sits outside the child's declared
  scope. The closure includes every parent package initializer along a dotted import, because Python
  executes those before the leaf module. The analysis is bounded and fails closed, and every route
  to other code it does *not* follow — dynamic import, `sys.path` insertion, installed distributions,
  native extensions' own imports, data files, non-Python entry points — is enumerated member by
  member in `references/predicates.md`.
- Settlement is performed rather than inferred, because a file on disk does not record whether it
  arrived by rename or by direct write. The child writes only an in-flight sibling of its
  destination; the orchestrator requires the destination to be byte-for-byte its pre-dispatch state
  and then renames the in-flight file into place itself. The predicate therefore reads only a
  renamed path. A directly written artifact, a missing deliverable, and an in-flight symlink are
  each refused with a real observation.
- Run binding is established before the child runs and stored in the register, never read from a
  file beside the artifact. An artifact from another run, another child, or another attempt is
  rejected, and the failure names the binding it does carry.
- Every child's deliverable lands in a directory that is exclusively its own and required to be
  invisible to the repository boundary. That is asked as the stronger question than "matched by an
  ignore rule": a tracked path stays visible to the boundary whatever the ignore rules say, so an
  artifact tree someone force-added is refused at dispatch with an actionable message rather than
  failing every later child on a control firing on the orchestrator's own rename. A read-only child's declared scope is a read scope, not a repository
  write allowlist. Concurrent read-only children with disjoint scopes therefore both complete
  cleanly, which they previously did not, while a read-only child that does write into the shared
  checkout still fails.
- The completion evaluator is held to the same boundary it enforces. Three surfaces are snapshotted
  immediately before the predicate runs and compared after it: the landing, the ambient checkout,
  and the artifact directory itself. The third is not redundant — that directory is required to be
  invisible to Git, so a predicate that rewrote the settled artifact after its digest was taken was
  previously a clean pass with a recorded digest that no longer matched the file. Any
  predicate-authored change fails as a predicate defect rather than being attributed to the child.
- Integration to the recorded destination is verified before reaping is possible — a `branch` tip
  that has not advanced and a `path` whose content has not changed both block verification, while
  `none` states that read-only work integrates nowhere instead of silently skipping the check.
- Judgment-shaped work, classified through fleet-core's authoritative work-shape vocabulary
  including its role-tier aliases, cannot reach `verified` on mechanical coverage alone. A depth
  sample records verifier identity, the digest binding it to this artifact, sampled claims, evidence
  locations, and dispositions from a closed set, and all of it is persisted to the register so a
  child that was genuinely sampled and one whose sample certified nothing are not the same green row.
  The named verifier must be a dispatch this orchestrator issued: an authenticated receipt for the
  verifier row, sealed under this repository, whose run matches and whose sealed runtime matches the
  sample's vendor, plus a phase that is one of the phases past launch and a matching recorded model.
  A register row alone is something a child can write. **What that establishes is that a verifier was
  dispatched in this repository, for this run, with this vendor — not that it ran.** The phase and
  model are register columns, not sealed fields, so moving a receipt-bearing verifier's phase from
  `planned` to `working` presents a session that never read anything; the phase check refuses the
  honest never-started case and not a planted one. It asks for membership in `launched`, `ready`,
  `working`, `verified`, `reaped` rather than refusing `planned` and `launching` by name, because a
  refusal written as exclusions accepts every value nobody thought of, including ones that are not
  phases at all. Sealing it needs post-launch evidence that lives in other units, and it is the same
  defect as the accepted residual on a child's own `phase` column, against a different column of the
  same untrusted store. A sample from the child
  itself, one recorded against another artifact, one with no claims, any unsupported claim, and a
  sample with no supported claim at all each block verification. Malformed external depth data is
  recorded as a closed failure rather than raised, because a control that raises instead of recording
  leaves the register showing a working child with no verdict.
- `references/predicates.md` states the completion contract, including for every control what it
  does **not** establish — notably that settlement does not prove how the child produced its
  in-flight file, that closure analysis does not follow dynamic imports, and that a depth sample
  cannot prove the verifier was blind.

### Changed

- Every child is launched with its runtime's ordinary workspace-write posture, mutating or not.
  A read-only flag forbade the artifact every child is required to write, and no supported CLI
  accepts a repository-relative path allowlist, so it never contained a read-only child — it only
  made its dispatch impossible to satisfy. That posture contains writes *outside* the workspace and
  nothing inside it; the boundary check is post-hoc, partial, repository-visible change detection
  that fails a child's completion rather than preventing its write, and a read-only child's
  repository write allowlist is empty.
- `GitLanding` answers two further boundary questions it already owned: whether a revision exists,
  and whether a path is genuinely invisible to the boundary — ignored *and* untracked. The scope
  helpers it shares with completion are now part of its public surface.
- A child's default environment command is `uv sync --locked --extra dev`, matching how this
  repository's CI provisions. A bare `uv sync` leaves a fresh worktree with no pytest, ruff or mypy,
  which is the set of programs a predicate is most likely to be, and that field exists precisely
  because a worktree cannot otherwise run its predicate at all.

### Not in this release

- Planning and vendor routing, admission control, spend and concurrency bounds, hang detection,
  mirror behavior, and the `/orchestrate` command.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-08-13

### Added

- Launch children through the `agent` wrapper's control-only path after validating its dry-run
  working directory and Herdr workspace. Launch intent and a run-bound task label are durable
  before the side effect, interrupted launches recover by discovering that label, and executable
  adapter tests pin every Herdr command to the default session and the installed argument grammar.
- Resolve model and effort through fleet-core's runtime adapter. Qwen's in-session effort command
  is sent after launch and accepted only after its own acknowledgement is observed; a timeout or
  disabled-thinking acknowledgement records a distinct not-ready source.
- Classify readiness through a nonce-bound `pane.output_matched` interaction whose complete
  sentinel never appears in echoed dispatch input. Trust prompts are surfaced before dispatch,
  dry-run routing mismatches fail before launch, and silent or continuously chatty panes remain
  bounded by the readiness deadline.
- Repair the subscriber's inert cross-counter revision guard. A captured live output-match event
  proves protocol 19 reports `read.revision=0`; the event envelope is now schema-validated through
  the production decoder instead of being discarded as stale.
- Provision mutating children in branch worktrees with an explicit environment-setup step; keep
  read-only children in the ambient checkout. Every child records a launch commit. Isolated child
  changes are compared with the current upstream merge base after merges or rebases, and any
  attributed ambient-checkout change by a mutating child violates the landing boundary regardless
  of its relative path. Shared-checkout violations state that authorship is not established, and the
  Git repository must contain a commit so committed-change observation cannot silently disable.
  Repository-visible changes are checked independently of predicate success; Git-ignored paths are
  documented as outside this control.
- Record reaping before closing a Herdr tab and distinguish a recorded reap from an unexplained
  disappearance.

### Not in this release

- Predicate implementations, the integration gate that authorizes live reaping, spend and
  concurrency admission, hang detection, mirror behavior, and the `/orchestrate` command.

## [0.2.2] - 2026-08-13

### Fixed

- Reject output-match subscriptions that cannot produce a complete substring sentinel instead of
  starting a subscriber that can only discard their events. Multiple valid sentinel interactions
  for the same pane remain independently matchable.
- Report catch-up failures without closing an accepted event stream, and count every accepted
  subscription toward reconnect limits even when its catch-up fails.
- Record how each lifecycle state was learned, including explicit inference labels for a missing
  snapshot pane and a closed tab.
- Avoid register locking for an empty catch-up batch and avoid waking for registered events that
  make no register change.
- Exercise schema-valid pane and agent payloads through the response parser and catch-up consumer.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-08-13

### Fixed

- Unwrap `session.snapshot` from Herdr's real `result.snapshot` response shape, now validated
  end-to-end against the committed success-response schema through a Unix-socket test.
- Resolve `tab_closed` through registered `tab_id` values, and record pane/tab terminal events as
  `exited` before waking the orchestrator.
- Fail fast when the subscriber's first socket connection cannot open; its register row now records
  `exited` and the command returns non-zero instead of retrying forever as `working`.
- Compare sentinel purpose and nonce as well as run and child identity, so an earlier dispatch or a
  readiness marker cannot satisfy a later completion interaction.
- Batch reconnect catch-up updates into one register rewrite and reset once-only diagnostics at
  each accepted connection.
- Clarify that the three subscription-event broadcasts remain dotted even though the 26 general
  broadcast events are underscored.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-08-13

### Added

- A strict protocol 19 event client for `~/.config/herdr/herdr.sock`. It emits dotted
  `events.subscribe` request types, rejects underscored broadcast names and malformed entries, and
  verifies the `subscription_started` acknowledgement before dispatching events.
- A single-purpose tracked subscriber process that holds the socket across turns and wakes the
  orchestrator pane through `agent.prompt`.
- Startup and reconnect catch-up through `session.snapshot`. It records `expected_state` versus
  `observed_state` disagreement and checks run-bound `artifact_path` presence without adding
  predicate wiring before predicate evaluation exists.
- `dispatch_revision_baseline`, the optional register column holding the pane revision sampled at
  dispatch. Run-and-child sentinels are honoured only at a later revision, preventing stale
  scrollback from satisfying a new interaction.
- A schema fixture captured from the installed herdr binary plus real Unix-socket tests for stream
  closure, reconnect, missed child exit recovery, and the remaining event-client error cases.

### Not in this release

- Session launching, readiness or reap transitions, predicate evaluation, routing, mirror
  behaviour, spend gating, hang detection, and the `/orchestrate` command.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-08-13

### Added

Initial scaffold (U2 of `docs/plans/2026-08-12-orchestrate-plugin-plan.md`). This ships the
plugin shape and the register only — the state model for a herdr-driven multi-vendor run, plus
the Claude<->Codex handoff seam (R12). Nothing else in the plan ships yet.

- `scripts/register.py`: a flat, global, `run_id`-keyed JSON register at
  `.orchestrate/register.json`, with atomic durable writes (temp sibling file, `fsync`, then
  `os.replace` — matching `run_ledger.py` and `manifest_store.py` elsewhere in this repository),
  an exclusive advisory lock around read-modify-write cycles so concurrent writers never lose
  each other's row, and a schema-version gate that halts with a durable receipt at
  `.orchestrate/halt-receipt.json` rather than mutating the register on an unsupported version
  (C3). Columns are grouped Identity / Substrate / Work / Lifecycle / Time / Accounting,
  documented in the module docstring.
- **Forward compatibility (C4) at both levels.** A key written by one runtime and unknown to the
  other survives a write by the other, whether it sits **inside a child row** or **at the
  document root**. Both matter to the handoff: rows are merged rather than replaced, and the
  loader preserves the document it read instead of rebuilding a known envelope, on both the
  upsert and the retire path. Genuinely optional columns stay absent rather than being seeded, so
  "unknown key" remains distinguishable from "known but unset" across the seam.
- **Retirement is idempotent.** Retiring a run moves its rows to
  `.orchestrate/runs/<run-id>/register-final.json` and leaves other runs untouched; retiring the
  same run again returns the existing archive rather than overwriting it. The durable copy is
  written before the live register is rewritten, so an interrupted retirement duplicates rows
  rather than losing them — and re-running it, which is the documented recovery, is safe.
- `skills/orchestrate/SKILL.md`: documents the register contract for later units to build against.
- `plugin.json` manifest and `README.md`.

### Not in this release

- The subscriber, `events.subscribe` client, session launching, predicate evaluation, spend
  gating, hang detection, routing, or the `/orchestrate` command itself. Those are later units
  (U3-U10) of the same plan.
