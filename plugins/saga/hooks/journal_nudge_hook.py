"""
PostToolUse hook: nudge when a commit that earned a journal entry omits one.

Fires after a Bash tool call that issues a `git commit`.  When the committed
diff touches code files, includes NO `docs/engineering-journal/` path, and
either the message starts with `feat`/`fix` or a model judges the commit to
have earned an entry, prints a one-line nudge to stderr.

The `feat`/`fix` prefix is a FLOOR, never a ceiling (issue 1036): the model is
asked only when the prefix did not already nudge, and it can only add a nudge,
never suppress one.  A `refactor` or `perf` commit carrying a non-obvious
mechanism is exactly the commit whose learning is worth writing down, and the
prefix rule passed every one of them in silence.

Properties (all by design):
  - NON-blocking: always exits 0.
  - NON-writing: never creates or edits journal files.
  - Cross-repo-safe: degrades quietly when the journal dir is absent or git
    is unavailable.
  - Silent on any model failure: a missing key, an error, a timeout or a slow
    vendor produces no output at all and costs at most `_JUDGMENT_DEADLINE`
    seconds.  `INFIQUETRA_TYPESAFE_JOURNAL_NUDGE=off` skips the call entirely.
  - Sends the commit's own message and file list, never a session transcript,
    a diff, or customer content.

Exit codes:
  0 — always (nudge or not, pass or error).
