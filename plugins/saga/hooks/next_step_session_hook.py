"""SessionStart hook: announce the run record's next step, and suppress it when the step is done.

Issue #1029. A new session in a repository with a live run opens knowing where the run is; a new
session in a repository whose run is finished, or which has no run at all, opens knowing nothing —
which is the point. The session that produced this card opened carrying a ``next_step`` left over
from an old saga tick, and a step announced after it is finished is worse than no announcement,
because it reads as an instruction.

Matched on ``startup|resume``. The ``compact`` source is the spore's
(``compact_spore_session_hook.py``), which re-injects the whole frozen block including the run
record; this hook is the cold-start reader the plugin did not have.

The suppression rule itself lives in ``scripts/next_step_context.py`` so the spore's renderer and
the prompt-submission suggestion read the same rule (plan KTD1, KTD5).

Properties, all by design and all shared with the hooks beside it:
  - ADVISORY: it injects context and can never block, refuse, or fail a turn.
  - QUIET on every error: an unreadable payload, a missing store, a cwd outside a repository, and
    an unreadable record each produce no output.
  - Exit code: 0, always.
