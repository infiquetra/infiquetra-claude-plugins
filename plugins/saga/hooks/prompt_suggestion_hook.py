"""UserPromptSubmit hook: name the saga command the operator's text is about. Locally. Advisory.

Issue #1029.

**Local only, and that is a data-governance constraint rather than a preference.** This hook makes
no network call, imports no client, and sends nothing off the machine. Issue #1038 measured a
typed-judgment version of this suggestion at 93 percent accuracy and still recommended *defer*, for
two separate reasons: no shape that makes a blocking call reaches the 400 millisecond target, and
whether the operator's live prompt text may be sent to a third-party vendor is an **open operator
decision** (``docs/analysis/2026-09-19-prompt-suggestion-latency.md``, sections 6 and 7). Until
that decision is made, the operator's prompt text is read in this process, matched against local
strings, and discarded. It is never logged, never written to a file, and never transmitted.

**Conservative by design.** The matcher claims only the high-precision case: the operator names a
command, or names the step the run record already says is next. One match suggests; no match and an
ambiguous match are both silence. A keyword table over a dozen commands cannot approach a typed
judgment's recall, and a hook that guesses is a hook the operator learns to ignore.

Properties, all by design:
  - ADVISORY: it prints at most one line of context; it never blocks and never rewrites a prompt.
  - QUIET on every error, and silent whenever the match is not clean.
  - Exit code: 0, always.
