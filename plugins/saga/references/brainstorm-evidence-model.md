# Brainstorm Evidence Model — Three Layers for Issue 915 (B3)

How the suite proves the behaviour B1 and B2 shipped without turning a
conversational judgment into a unit-test fact. Prior art reviewed, shape
reused, and what this suite explicitly does **not** prove.

## Prior art — reviewed and recorded

Four candidates already in the repository were reviewed before designing
this model. Each verdict is a fit decision, not a reimplementation.

| Candidate | Location | Verdict | Reason |
|---|---|---|---|
| Data-file case suite + injectable runner + deterministic graders | `plugins/saga/scripts/engine_benchmark.py` + `plugins/saga/references/benchmark-suite.yaml` — header states graders are never model-graded | **Reuse the shape** | Cases as data, runner injectable, grading deterministic and never LLM-judged; live grading opt-in behind env var, never in CI (R23, KTD5) |
| Markdown rubrics with narrative scoring bands | `plugins/saga/references/rubrics/` + `plugins/saga/scripts/lifecycle_review.py` | **Reuse the dimension vocabulary, decline the Markdown carrier** | R19 needs per-dimension reporting with rubric as data, not inlined prose assertions; Markdown would require parsing and would hide the rubric from the grader's structured input |
| Standalone AST visitor + fixtures + whole-suite invariant | `scripts/lint_test_shape.py` + `tests/test_lint_test_shape.py` | **Reuse the mechanism** | `ast.NodeVisitor` plus dataclass report plus whole-suite invariant for R17's mechanical dialogue-assertion check |
| In-memory string surgery feeding a pure analyzer | `tests/test_concurrency_conformance.py::_mutate_source` | **Reuse the mechanism** | Mutation proof via `text.replace(needle, "", 1)` feeding the same `check_*(text)` predicate (KTD3) |

## Layer 1 — Deterministic contract boundary, mechanically enforced

`tests/test_brainstorm_evidence_model.py` walks the AST of every
`tests/test_brainstorm_*.py` module. Scope: the check collects every question-shaped string
constant **module-wide** — module-level `Assign` targets, helper-function return values,
`parametrize` decorator arguments, literals inside `assert` statements, and any other string
literal — so the earlier escape hatches (a question held in a module constant, returned by a
helper predicate, or fed through `parametrize`) are detected, not missed. Docstrings are the
one deliberate exclusion (the visitor proves a node is a docstring by parent shape before
skipping it), plus the module's own definition of question-shapedness (the `_INTERROGATIVES`
tuple and `_is_question_shaped`). The remaining blind spot is deliberate: JSON data files
(such as `tests/data/brainstorm/`) are not Python source, so the walk does not see them —
those cases are authored design data, not test assertions. The check fails on:

- any question-shaped string constant outside a docstring — one that ends with `?` or opens
  with an interrogative (`what`, `how`, `why`, `who`, `when`, `which`, `can you`, `could you`)
  — wherever it appears in the module;
- any `assert` whose comparison involves an ordered sequence (list/tuple literal) of
  two or more such question-shaped literals.

The walk is `ast.NodeVisitor` only; no substring search over the file.
This proves R17 over the test sources rather than by reviewer promise:
no deterministic test asserts which question is asked, its wording, or
the order of the creative dialogue.

Deterministic coverage is also asserted: a keyword-presence scan over the test sources against a
hardcoded `_AREA_KEYWORDS` list checks that artifact metadata, resume
lookup, the declared `brainstorm-scope-confirmation` gate,
scope-confirmation state, terminal routing, and helper ceilings are mentioned; it does not prove an
assertion executed.

## Layer 2 — Scenario evaluations scored per dimension

`tests/data/brainstorm/scenarios.json` holds the case set. Each case
carries `id`, `idea_seed`, `product_size` and `consequence` as
**independent** fields, `material_dimensions`, `expected` per dimension,
and `transcript` (`captured` or `none`). The set varies both variables
independently (not collinear) and includes at minimum the four required
failure-mode kinds: `premature-convergence`, `missed-material-gap`,
`consequence-calibration`, `checklist-overengineering`.

`tests/data/brainstorm/rubric.json` holds dimensions and their band
descriptions as data, never inlined in assertions.

Scenario data stores `expected` per dimension as authored design input; no `grade()` function exists yet and no live runner is wired. Layer 2 proves the data shape and per-dimension structure, not that any transcript was graded.

**Authored case data is expected and permitted.** `scenarios.json`,
`rubric.json`, and `calibration.json` are authored by this unit: they
define the idea seed, the two independent variables, the material
dimensions, and the expected outcome per dimension. That is design input,
not evidence.

**Captured transcripts are optional and additive.** Where a parked-checkpoint run
transcript exists, a future `grade()` would run against it and the case would record
`transcript: captured`. Where none exists, the case records
`transcript: none` and the offline suite proves only what it can honestly prove today — shape, coverage, per-dimension reporting, no-aggregate, and gating. Calibration agreement will be proven when a grader exists; until then the offline suite proves the calibration data shape only. A missing failure-mode transcript never
blocks U3.

**The one thing that stays forbidden is mislabelling.** No case may
carry a synthesized transcript labelled `captured`. That is the
harness-substitution failure this constraint prevents.

No aggregate number is computed, stored, or reported. The result object
exposes no `score`, `total`, `aggregate`, `overall`, or `quality` key at
any level, and no consumer computes one (R19). Reporting is per
dimension only.

## Layer 3 — Evaluator trust and safeguard-phrase drift guard

*Audience: maintainer of tests and contract files. Version: 0.149.0.*

**Evaluator-trust rule (R20).** `is_blocking(finding, *, reproducible,
second_grader_agrees, operator_adjudicated) -> bool` returns `True`
unconditionally for a deterministic contract failure, and for a
model-judged finding returns `True` only when the scenario is
reproducible **and** either a second independent grader agrees or an
operator adjudication is recorded. The deterministic case plus the four decisive model-judged combinations are asserted directly.

**Calibration (R21).** `tests/data/brainstorm/calibration.json` holds a
small fixed set of cases with expected grades and a `drift_floor` key that today has no consumer. No grader exists yet; the test asserts only that the calibration data has the expected shape (three cases, each with `id` and `expected` per rubric dimension) and that no aggregate target exists. Drift will be surfaced when a grader is built; until then the floor is data only.

**Safeguard-phrase drift guard (R22).** `tests/test_brainstorm_mutation_proofs.py`
carries one case per safeguard U1 and U2 declared critical — eight in
total: the ambiguity stop, the fresh-confirmation rule, the route-gating
on declared readiness, the no-deferred-save rule, the helper ceiling,
the map-privacy rule, the no-named-assurance-level rule, and the helper
read-only capability rule. Each case reads the real file, removes the
rule's text in memory, calls the same `check_*` predicate the contract
test calls, asserts violation, then asserts the unmutated text reports
none. These prove the safeguard sentence is present and its predicate is wired — not that the safeguard's behaviour holds. A meta-assertion requires every safeguard named in the
declared-critical list to have a case, so adding a safeguard without a
drift-guard case fails.

## What this suite does not prove

The suite proves the deterministic boundary, the data shape and per-dimension structure, and the gating machinery. It does **not** prove that any
given brainstorm was good and it does not prove any transcript was graded — Layer 2 has no grader yet and the drift check is deferred. Layer 3's eight cases prove a safeguard sentence is present and its predicate is wired, not that the safeguard's behaviour holds — a file edited to instruct the opposite of a safeguard while keeping its sentence would still pass the string check. Formal completeness and contradiction review
stay after the confirmed artifact, in Document Review or a narrow
post-write validator, never in the live dialogue. A green scenario run
without a captured transcript proves the case set's shape, not the quality of a conversation that was never
captured. The AST check's scope is as described in Layer 1: question-shaped string constants are
detected module-wide across the brainstorm test modules; docstrings, the checker's own
definitions, and non-Python data files stay outside it.

## Offline and side-effect-free (R23)

The harness runs offline, writes nothing under `docs/brainstorms/`,
mutates no path under `.claude/saga/`, and opens no socket.
