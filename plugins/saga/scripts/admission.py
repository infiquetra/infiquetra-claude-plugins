"""The admission questionnaire — asked once, at the front of a run (issue #1023).

The software-development-lifecycle repository already enumerates what has to be settled before
work starts: the card contract, the Risk tier, the seven approval boundaries, the six issue-review
checks, and thirteen run-configuration parameters. Nothing implemented any of it, so the operator
answered those questions by hand, in prose, every time. This module implements it:

1. Run the card validator. A card that fails stops the step, names the missing fields, and writes
   nothing — planning against a half-formed card is the failure the lifecycle repository's Shaping
   exit exists to prevent.
2. Fill every defaultable run-configuration parameter from the per-repository profile, the
   lifecycle repository's decided defaults, and fleet-core's staffing component, recording where
   each value came from.
3. Print the questions that remain — and only those. An answer already in the run record is never
   asked again.

**This module never prompts.** It emits a question set and consumes an answers file (plan KTD6).
Putting the one message to the operator is the ``/plan`` skill's job, because the skill is what has
a conversation; keeping interactive input out of here is what makes "the operator is asked exactly
once" a property a test can check rather than something a human has to observe.

Exit codes are the run record's (see ``references/run-record.md``): 0 success, 2 a refusal —
including a card that fails the validator — and 3 an unknown record version.
