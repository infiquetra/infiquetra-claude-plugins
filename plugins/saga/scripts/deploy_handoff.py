"""deploy_handoff.py — positive handoff-ack envelope at the saga -> deploy edge (issue #395).

`/work` owns the PR loop through merge and explicitly disclaims deploy. Nothing today requires
deploy to acknowledge picking a merged item up, so a dropped baton is invisible. This sidecar
module owns the acceptance contract that closes that gap (R1/R3/R4/R5):

* ``offer`` mints an ack token (``secrets.token_hex``) and writes a per-saga sidecar
  ``.claude/saga/sagas/<saga_id>/deploy_handoff.json`` with the gate-or-auto payload. The payload
  and ``pr_refs`` are read from the saga record (``state.json["sagas"][saga_id]``, KTD3) — an
  absent posture reads the safe ``gate`` default (R5) and is never overridable from an offer-time
  argument (R2). A repeat ``offer`` (a crashed deploy run, F2 recovery) mints a *fresh*
  token and moves the prior envelope to ``superseded`` so a stale token can never be acked (KTD4).
* ``accept`` is write-once (KTD4): it records ``{token, acknowledged_at, acknowledged_by,
  evidence}`` only on the deploy side. A second accept raises ``AlreadyAcknowledgedError`` (mirrors
  ``ship_receipt.ReceiptExistsError``); accept without a prior offer, a token mismatch, or an empty
  identity/evidence all fail loud with named errors — ownership is never released silently.
* ``authorize_promotion`` honors the payload mechanically, not by convention (KTD5): ``gate`` ->
  blocked pending explicit confirmation; ``auto`` -> authorized for ``nonprod`` only;
  ``staging``/``production`` always require confirmation regardless of payload.
* ``reconcile`` (U3, read-only) derives status on read, per-saga or via an ``--all`` sweep across
  ``.claude/saga/sagas/*/deploy_handoff.json``: an offer with no ack is
  ``handed-off-unacknowledged`` (R4 — ownership is never released until the ack is on disk; this
  is the dropped-baton case, F2); an offer with an ack is ``accepted``; no sidecar at all is
  ``no-handoff`` (deliberately not an error). Nothing is written back — no committed status field
  anywhere (KTD6).

Storage follows the established sidecar discipline (``ship_receipt.py`` / ``ship_teardown.py``):
saga-id regex hardening, wrapped ``JSONDecodeError``, atomic tmp-then-``os.replace`` writes, no
``state.json`` contention. Write-once is enforced at the API layer (named errors on double-accept
/ token mismatch), NOT at the filesystem — unlike ``ship_receipt``'s ``O_CREAT|O_EXCL``, which is
inapplicable here because ``accept`` mutates an already-existing offer file. The sidecar is
git-ignored, machine-local, single-operator state; a local hand-edit or a same-instant concurrent
accept is outside the trust model, same as every sibling sidecar.
