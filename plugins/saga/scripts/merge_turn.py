"""merge_turn — one worker merges at a time, over the run record (issue 1028).

The lifecycle repository's ``docs/process/parent-branch-integration.md`` describes the protocol
this module implements: exactly one worker holds the merge turn at any moment while implementation
stays parallel, the turn is ordinary execution state rather than a lock service, the merging worker
resolves straightforward conflicts as normal work, and ``main`` is re-integrated into the surviving
branches after each merge.

Four properties are load-bearing, and each one is a test:

* **Only the holder merges.** The holder is derived from the record's ``units[].merge_state``, and
  a row left at ``merging`` by a turn that died is RELEASED rather than trusted — a turn is live
  only while its own merge worktree is still registered and still holds an unfinished merge. That
  derivation is why no lock is needed: there is nothing to expire and nothing to steal.
* **The destination follows the record.** ``admission.destination`` decides whether a unit merges
  onto the run's parent issue branch or onto the default branch. Nothing else chooses.
* **A merge that would revert a newer comparison branch is refused by name.** The guard is
  fleet-core's ``merge_guard``, fetched first; a guard evaluated against a stale remote-tracking
  reference passes silently, which is the failure card 875 reported.
* **Both re-integrations happen and both are reported.** After a merge, the advanced destination
  branch is merged into every surviving unit branch, and where the destination is a parent issue
  branch the freshly fetched comparison branch is merged into it. A conflict in either is named and
  left for the worker who owns it.

**No lock, no lease, no reservation, no receipt.** The parent issue 1018 forbids adding one and
card 1028's stop condition says to stop and report if a merge-turn case would need one to be
correct. None of the cases here does: every refusal above is derived from git or from the record.

House pattern: pure functions over explicit values, an injectable runner so tests drive real git in
a temporary repository, lazy imports of the sibling modules, and no I/O at import.
