"""Saga Plan's versioned structured pre-answer carrier (#924, ``plan_pre_answers.v1``).

A caller that has already settled a decision hands it to ``/plan`` as a fenced JSON
block in the invocation text, instead of letting the conversation re-ask it:

```json
{
  "schema": "plan_pre_answers.v1",
  "caller": "orchestrate",
  "backend": "inline",
  "destination": "plan-only"
}
```

Intake, not a phase (plan KTD4): evaluated once, before the conversation begins. The
only visible effects a carrier may produce are narration of an applied value together
with its caller, and the absence of a question that would otherwise have been asked.

Contract shape (plan KTD5):

* ``schema`` — the version token ``plan_pre_answers.v1``. Two cases, stated as the code
  performs them: a non-v1 token INSIDE the ``plan_pre_answers`` family (case-insensitive,
  token boundary) is refused whole — no field from that carrier is applied; a FOREIGN
  schema family is not a carrier at all and is ignored.
* ``backend`` — decision field, from ``inline | team-execution | cc-workflows-ultracode``
  (the enum Phase 5.2 records into the plan-doc ``backend:`` field). Optional. Operator
  ruling (review F03, stricter than #808): the carrier applies ONLY ``inline``
  automatically; ``team-execution`` and ``cc-workflows-ultracode`` are legal plan values
  but require explicit operator invocation, so the carrier stops and surfaces instead of
  applying them.
* ``destination`` — decision field, from ``plan-only | pr | merge | nonprod-deploy``
  (the enum Phase 5.1 asks and the tick's ``--destination`` carries). Optional. Both
  omitted is a valid empty carrier.
* ``caller`` — envelope metadata naming the supplying capability for the narration.
  NOT a decision field: exactly two decision fields are admitted, and ``caller`` sits
  outside that admission limit.

Carrier discipline (reviews F08/F08a/F15/F30, cycle-2 C03/P02/S01): the block's fence
info string must be exactly ``json``; at most one carrier may be present — two carriers
stop the run rather than letting the first win silently; duplicate JSON keys stop the run
rather than applying the last value; and a ``json``-fenced block that fails to parse or
repeats a key is a malformed carrier — a stop — only when it is carrier-shaped (its raw
text names the ``plan_pre_answers`` family). An unrelated malformed JSON example is
prose, ignored exactly as a foreign schema already is: the stop must never over-fire on
invocation text that carries no carrier.

Pure functions: reads the text it is given, writes nothing, reads no file (KTD5).
