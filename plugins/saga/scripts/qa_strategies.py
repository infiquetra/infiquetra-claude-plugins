"""The /qa strategy catalogue — selection, preflight, drivers, evidence and the verdict (#1039).

`/qa` is the lifecycle's functional-test step: it runs after the release step deploys to the
non-production destination and decides whether the shipped thing actually works. It was a nine-way
risk router that improvised its checks and reported a language-model-scored health number. It is
now a catalogue of ten prescribed strategies held as data, and every decision in this module is
arithmetic:

1. **Selection is computed, never judged.** The repository profile's file patterns against the
   change's file list give the required set, and each entry records the pattern that selected it.
2. **The boundary filters the selection.** The three proof boundaries are a ladder, widest last:
   ``hermetic < branch-preview < non-production``. A run at boundary B selects every strategy whose
   boundary is B or narrower and records the rest as out-of-boundary — a selection fact, never a
   result and never proof debt.
3. **The advisory judgment may only widen.** The floor is computed BEFORE the client is called and
   the answer is unioned, never intersected. Its absence, its timeout and its error all degrade to
   the declared set; no run fails because a judgment was unavailable.
4. **The preflight refuses whole or not at all.** Over the profile's ceiling, or missing a
   credential the operator holds, zero drivers run. Running the affordable subset and reporting a
   partial pass is the failure this design exists to remove.
5. **A driver returns one of three results.** ``passed``, ``failed``, ``blocked``. There is no
   fourth value and no silent skip. A driver that cannot start is ``blocked``, never an exception
   that ends the run.
6. **The verdict is counted, not scored.** No model assigns a severity here and nothing is weighted.

Exit codes:

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 0 | the verdict is ``pass`` or ``pass-with-proof-debt`` |
| 1 | an internal error |
| 2 | a refusal — the preflight refused the whole selection, the profile proves nothing, or there is no profile |
| 3 | an unknown record version |
| 4 | the verdict is ``fail`` |
| 5 | a required strategy is ``blocked``; the run stops for the operator |

4 and 5 are separate on purpose: a failure re-enters the build loop and a required block does not.
