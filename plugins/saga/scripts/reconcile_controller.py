"""reconcile_controller — the ONE level-triggered board-reconcile controller (#450).

Kubernetes-style level-triggered convergence, shared by ``/outcome``, ``/work``, and ``/loop``.
Before #450 the two halves of board consistency lived in two ``/outcome``-only modules and were
unavailable to the other two commands:

* the **idempotency-key write** half — extracted to ``board_progression.authorize_and_write``
  (#344): authorize via ``reversibility_certificate`` (default-GATE), key into a separate ledger,
  drive an injected ``board_writer`` with bounded retry, record fail-loud. This module *composes*
  that primitive; it does not re-derive it.
* the **drift-detect/decide** half — the vocabulary and record shape (:data:`DRIFT_KINDS`,
  :func:`_drift_record`, :func:`_drift_id`, :func:`_close_satisfies_contract`) that ``/outcome``'s
  resume-time detector (``outcome_reconcile``, #295) used to own privately. #450 moves that
  vocabulary HERE and ``outcome_reconcile`` re-exports it, so the drift classification is
  single-sourced (zero behavior change to ``/outcome`` — regression-tested).

On top of those two shared halves this module adds the piece ``/work`` and ``/loop`` were missing: a
per-op **level-triggered reconcile tick** (:func:`reconcile_op`, driven in bulk by :func:`reconcile`)
that, every tick, recomputes the expected board value from durable saga fields and re-reads the live
board, so a rapid double tick converges on one write and an outside edit to a saga-owned field is
re-detected and surfaced as a named HALT — never silently corrected (W7: the controller holds no
autonomous lifecycle-field write authority; see :data:`AUTO_CORRECT_OP_KINDS`).

Threat model / self-attestation (the panel probes exact wording):

* The controller holds **no autonomous lifecycle-field write authority** (W7, SDLC R30/R32):
  :data:`AUTO_CORRECT_OP_KINDS` is empty, so no outside drift is ever silently re-written — every
  drift HALTs with a named reason for the operator, who routes any correction back through the
  mission-control mutation contract (M7: pause automated writes, route through the operator). The
  correcting write, when an operator-ratified change restores it, is **fail-closed and doubly
  gated**: it fires only when the certificate returns ``AUTHORIZED`` *and* the op is in the explicit
  :data:`AUTO_CORRECT_OP_KINDS` allowlist. Any op outside that allowlist, and any GATE verdict,
  HALTs; the controller never widens the autonomously-writable set (that lives in
  ``reversibility_certificate``, #344 KTD2).
* The controller **never reverses an outside issue open/closed change**. A drift whose correction
  would re-drive ``sub-issue-close`` / ``sub-issue-reopen`` is HALTed, not silently overwritten,
  because reversing an external close/reopen would destroy a human/CI lifecycle decision. This is a
  self-attested policy line, not a mathematical property of the certificate (which marks both those
  ops mechanically reversible); the allowlist is the enforcement, this paragraph is the claim.
* Idempotency is only as strong as the injected ``write_once`` (``os.link`` atomic create) and the
  caller serializing ticks (``/outcome`` runs under the coordinator lease). Under true simultaneous
  ticks the ledger dedups to one file; the *board* write is idempotent by nature (re-setting a field
  to the same value is a no-op).

House pattern (mirrors the other saga scripts): pure functions over explicit values, lazy imports of
heavy modules, no I/O at import.
