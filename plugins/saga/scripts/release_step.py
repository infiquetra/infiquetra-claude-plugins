"""release_step — the release, the functional test, and the close, over the run record (1028).

These three steps used to live only in prose in a skill document, which meant three of card 1028's
requirements had no executable guard. Behaviour that cannot be tested is behaviour nobody can tell
is broken, so it lives here instead and the skill calls it.

Three commands, and what each one refuses:

* ``release`` merges the parent pull request and records what landed. It binds the merge to the
  head it waited on with ``gh pr merge --match-head-commit``, so the server that owns the reference
  performs the compare-and-swap: a local read-then-compare is a time-of-check-to-time-of-use race,
  which this repository's journal records at ``DECISIONS.md:9485``. It classifies a refusal from
  GitHub's ``mergeStateStatus`` rather than trusting a watch command's exit status — the same
  journal records a pull request squash-merged while its merge state was ``UNSTABLE``
  (``LEARNINGS.md:11001``). The commit that lands is recorded SEPARATELY from the head that was
  checked, because a squash or a rebase produces a different commit and a closing comment that
  links a commit nothing ever checked is worse than one that links nothing.
* ``deploy`` hands the merged revision to the deploy plugin's existing handoff — but only where the
  repository profile declares a non-production destination. Where it declares ``none``, as this
  repository does, the absence is RECORDED with its reason and nothing is deployed. That is a
  result, not an error: the lifecycle's closeout rule forbids fabricating a deployment record, and
  failing here would block every run in a repository that has no lower environment.
* ``functional-test`` records each prescribed scenario's terminal state and counts a failure
  against the post-merge allowance, which keeps its own counter of three standard and two escalated
  cycles plus exactly one recorded extension.
* ``close`` composes the closeout comment the lifecycle repository's ``terminal-outcomes.md``
  requires, and REFUSES to compose one that would state an environment, a deployment or an
  acceptance result the record does not carry.

No production deployment exists anywhere in this module, and there is no argument that would
produce one.

House pattern: pure functions over explicit values, an injected runner for every ``gh`` call so no
test reaches GitHub, and no I/O at import.
