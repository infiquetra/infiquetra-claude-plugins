"""Write ``review_result.v2`` into the run record, and publish it as one comment.

WHAT THIS MODULE OWNS
=====================

Serialising a review result, giving every finding one stable identity, keeping one
review history per unit, preparing the residual defects when the repair allowance
runs out, and rendering the result as exactly one pull-request comment. Filing
those defects is mission-control's, not this module's: opening an issue is that
plugin's ownership lane. It owns no policy: what
a lens means, what threshold it must reach and what shape acceptance takes all come
from the roster :mod:`review_roster` resolved, and the verdict itself is computed
by :mod:`review_consensus`.

FINDING IDENTITY
================

The lifecycle repository's catalogue gives every finding one fingerprint — path,
line and category — that survives across cycles, so the same defect keeps one
identity however many lenses report it. Two reviewers reporting the same defect
produce **one** finding with the agreement recorded, not two. A duplicate is
recorded ``duplicate-of`` against the finding it repeats: not deleted, and not
counted twice. Similar wording is not evidence of the same defect, so wording is
not part of the fingerprint.

ONE HISTORY PER UNIT
====================

A unit has one review history for the life of the run. Starting a fresh one is
refused, because a fresh history resets the cycle counter and puts scores from two
different lens sets side by side as though they were comparable. That is the whole
of issue 946.

ONE COUNTER PER LOOP
====================

A run has two repair loops — the pre-merge code-review loop and the post-merge
repair loop — and each keeps its **own** allowance and its own count under the same
rules. Every entry therefore carries a ``loop`` field valued ``code_review`` or
``post_merge``, and the allowance check counts entries whose loop matches rather
than the array's length. Without the field a long testing phase would silently
spend the pre-merge budget.

READING AN OLDER RESULT
=======================

A ``review_result.v1`` entry already in a record is reported by name, preserved
unchanged, and counted toward no allowance: its cycle accounting used a different
acceptance rule and is not comparable to this one. Silently upgrading it would put
incomparable scores in one history, which is the thing above this one exists to
prevent.

PUBLICATION
===========

Exactly one pull-request comment, naming the reviewed revision as a full
forty-character commit identifier. **Never an approving review**, in any of its
forms. Publication commits nothing, pushes nothing, and does not advance ``HEAD`` —
issue 935 reports the opposite arrangement, where publishing the artifact moved the
branch and broke the caller's freshness check.

Publication lives in this module rather than a fourth script because issue 1001
names exactly three, and because binding the comment to the result it renders is
what makes it impossible to publish a comment naming a revision other than the one
the result records.
