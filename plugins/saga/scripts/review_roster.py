"""Resolve one run's review roster by invoking the lifecycle repository's own generator.

WHAT THIS IS, AND WHAT IT DELIBERATELY IS NOT
=============================================

This module turns the lens declaration recorded at admission into a
``review_roster.v1`` document. It does that by **running**
``tools/docs/gen_review_roster.py`` from a checkout of ``infiquetra/infiquetra-sdlc``
(called "the lifecycle repository" throughout) as a subprocess, and carrying the
document it prints through unchanged.

It does **not** reimplement the resolution, and no copy of the generator is
vendored here. That is architecture decision record ADR-001's boundary: the
lifecycle repository owns what a lens means, which lenses exist, what strictness
applies and what threshold must be met; this plugin owns execution and nothing
else. A second implementation of the resolution would be a second policy owner,
whatever its author intended.

Invoking rather than porting is possible because the generator is self-contained:
it imports only the standard library and resolves the catalogue, the quality
profile and the executor-verification ledger relative to its own location. Issue
1001 carried a stop condition — stop if the generator cannot be invoked without
vendoring it — and it does not fire.

THE DECLARATION THIS MODULE BUILDS
==================================

The generator's input is an ``applicability_declaration.v1``. The run record has
no field of that shape: it carries the admission answer
``run_configuration.applicable_lenses``, which names the always-on lenses, the
conditional lenses that apply, and a reason for each conditional lens left out.
:func:`build_declaration` is the one place the two shapes meet, so they can be
compared rather than confused.

FINDING THE LIFECYCLE CHECKOUT
==============================

Through fleet-core's staffing component, whose order is an explicit path, then
``INFIQUETRA_SDLC_PATH``, then ``~/workspace/infiquetra/infiquetra-sdlc``.

**Two environment variables name the same thing in this tree right now.** The
staffing component and mission-control read ``INFIQUETRA_SDLC_PATH``; sixteen role
prompts under ``plugins/agent-launcher/roles/`` say ``INFIQUETRA_SDLC_ROOT``.
Setting one does not set the other, so a review whose controller resolved the
checkout one way would brief lens sessions that resolve it another way or not at
all. ``INFIQUETRA_SDLC_PATH`` wins here because it is the name the *code* reads;
``INFIQUETRA_SDLC_ROOT`` is accepted as a second-priority read so the mismatch
surfaces as a sentence rather than as an empty resolution, and
:func:`resolve_checkout` always reports which of the two it used. Repointing the
role prompts is issue 1022's file, and a follow-up.

WHEN THE CHECKOUT IS ABSENT
===========================

A named refusal, never a fallback roster. A fallback policy is still a policy, and
the whole point of ADR-001 is that this plugin owns none. The deleted
``references/lens-roster.json`` is never resurrected as one.

USAGE
=====

::

    review_roster.py --declaration decl.json
    review_roster.py --issue 1001 --revision <sha>
    review_roster.py --issue 1001 --revision <sha> --sdlc-path /path/to/checkout
    review_roster.py --declaration decl.json --propose

Exit codes: ``0`` the generator's validation report is ``ok``; ``1`` the report is
``refused`` (a run-setup fact the caller must see, not a crash); ``2`` a refusal
this module owns — no checkout, no generator, or a run record with no lens
declaration; ``3`` an unknown run-record version.

``--propose`` prints the advisory conditional-lens proposal for the declaration
and exits ``0`` without resolving a roster: the proposed additions with their
probabilities, the Planner's declaration as the floor, and a note when the
judgment contributed nothing. It needs no lifecycle checkout and leaves the
declaration's lenses intact — the Planner applies additions explicitly, through
:func:`apply_proposal`, before the roster resolves.
