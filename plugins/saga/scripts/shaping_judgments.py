"""Typed judgments for the three shaping commands (issue 1037, plan U1-U4).

`/ideate`, `/brainstorm` and `/office-hours` each make several small repeated
judgments per run that an orchestrating model makes today by reading prose.
This module asks those judgments as typed questions -- a yes/no probability, a
pick from a fixed set, or a position on an ordered rubric -- batched one request
per body of text, through the fleet-core TypeSafe client that issue 1032
shipped.  There is no HTTP code here, no retry code, no redaction code and no
second client: `typesafe_client.ask` owns all of that, and its `prepare_state`
is the only path to a transport, so redaction cannot be skipped from here.

Every answer is advisory.  Nothing in this module returns an instruction,
selects an option on a caller's behalf, or removes anything from its input: the
dedupe judgment *groups*, and the set of identifiers coming out equals the set
going in.  Every judgment fails open -- on a non-`ok` status, an absent
`TYPESAFE_API_KEY`, a timeout, or a declined judgment the caller behaves exactly
as it did before this module existed, and the command-line front door still
exits zero, because a failed advisory call is not a failed command.

    shaping_judgments.py readiness --doc docs/brainstorms/<a requirements doc>.md
    shaping_judgments.py dedupe --state '{"candidates": [{"id": "C1", ...}]}'
    shaping_judgments.py route --doc <a frame note> --log

Verdicts are recorded only for calls that produced an answer, which is what
`plugins/fleet-core/scripts/jev.py` does: the evaluation harness scores answers,
and a declined or failed judgment has no answer to score.
