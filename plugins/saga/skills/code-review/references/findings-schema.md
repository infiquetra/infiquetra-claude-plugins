# Findings Schema

Every review lens returns findings in this schema. It is adopted from CE's findings schema so findings
are **agent-consumable** — `autofix_class` and `owner` are routing metadata a downstream fixer reads.
`/code-review` itself only reports, classifies, and routes; it never applies a fix.

**Formatting contract.** The output below already tables findings (the pipe-delimited interactive table);
that satisfies the shared contract in
`saga/references/formatting-style.md`. When the report carries
any surrounding narrative (the Coverage section, the outcome blockquote), keep it as short (≤3-sentence)
blank-line-separated prose and lead each block with a one-line summary. Do **not** re-table the findings —
the schema and its table are canonical.

## Per-finding fields

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `title` | yes | Short, specific issue title (<= 10 words). |
| `severity` | yes | `P0` / `P1` / `P2` / `P3`. |
| `dimension_id` | yes | Canonical dimension identifier whose score reflects this finding. |
| `critical` | yes | `FindingEvidence` score-consistency signal described below; this field is not serialized on `ReviewFinding`. |
| `file` | yes | Repo-relative path. |
| `line` | yes | Primary line number (>= 1). |
| `why_it_matters` | yes | The failure mode — what *breaks*, not what is wrong. |
| `autofix_class` | yes | Routing class (below). |
| `owner` | yes | Who owns the next action (below). |
| `requires_verification` | yes | Whether a fix needs targeted tests or a re-review pass. |
| `confidence` | yes | One anchor: `0` / `25` / `50` / `75` / `100`. |
| `evidence` | yes | >= 1 code-grounded item, each citing `file:line` or a snippet. |
| `pre_existing` | yes | True if the issue is in unchanged code this diff did not introduce. |
| `suggested_fix` | optional | Concrete minimal fix (rule below). |

`critical` is a score-consistency assertion, not another Priority or outcome gate. A reviewer sets it
to `true` when an unresolved finding means its mapped dimension cannot honestly be non-applicable or
meet the dimension floor; set it to `false` otherwise. Reconciliation still treats every active,
non-pre-existing, non-advisory P0 as critical, so an omitted or default `false` cannot downgrade that
derived signal. A pre-existing or advisory P0 remains non-critical for scoring and creates no fix request.

The typed result serializes these fields without translating the routing values:

```json
{
  "finding_id": "F-12",
  "lens_id": "correctness",
  "dimension_id": "state-data-invariants",
  "title": "Rollback loses the prior state",
  "severity": "P1",
  "file": "src/state.py",
  "line": 42,
  "why_it_matters": "A failed update leaves the stored state inconsistent.",
  "autofix_class": "gated_auto",
  "owner": "review-fixer",
  "requires_verification": true,
  "confidence": 100,
  "evidence": ["src/state.py:42"],
  "pre_existing": false,
  "suggested_fix": "Restore the previous value in the existing failure branch.",
  "touched_paths": ["src/state.py", "tests/test_state.py"],
  "status": "active"
}
```

## Severity (P0-P3)

- **P0** — Critical breakage, exploitable vulnerability, data loss/corruption. Highest routing urgency.
- **P1** — High-impact defect likely hit in normal usage, breaking a contract. High routing urgency.
- **P2** — Moderate issue with a meaningful downside (edge case, perf regression, maintainability trap).
  Fix if straightforward.
- **P3** — Low-impact, narrow scope, minor improvement. User's discretion.

## Confidence — 5 anchors with behavioral criteria

Use exactly one of these — floats are invalid (the model cannot calibrate finer; discrete anchors prevent
false-precision gaming):

- **0** — Not confident. A false positive that does not survive light scrutiny, OR a pre-existing issue
  this PR did not introduce. Do not report.
- **25** — Somewhat confident. Might be real, might be a false positive; could not verify from the diff and
  surrounding code alone. Do not report.
- **50** — Moderately confident. Verified real but a nitpick, narrow edge case, or minimal impact. Style
  preferences land here. Report only when P0 (or when synthesis routes to advisory).
- **75** — Highly confident. Double-checked: it will affect users, downstream callers, or runtime behavior
  in normal usage. Report.
- **100** — Absolutely certain. Verifiable from the code alone — compile error, type mismatch, definitive
  logic bug, or a quotable project-standards violation. Report.

**Report admission:** below anchor 75, do not report — **except** a P0 at anchor 50+ (a
critical-but-uncertain issue must not be silently dropped). This admission rule and the validator 15-cap
control evidence volume. Confidence and Priority are metadata; neither is a review-acceptance gate.

## autofix_class — routing metadata (4 values)

- **safe_auto** — Local, deterministic fix suitable for an in-skill fixer: one-sentence fix, no "depends on"
  clauses, no change to function signature / public API / error contract / security posture / permission
  model. Examples: extract a duplicated helper, add a missing nil check, fix an off-by-one, add a missing
  test, remove dead code. Bias toward `safe_auto` when the rubric permits.
- **gated_auto** — A concrete fix exists but it changes a contract, permission, or behavior, or its
  placement needs a design conversation. Needs approval before apply. Examples: add auth to an unprotected
  endpoint, change an API response shape.
- **manual** — Actionable work that needs a design decision or cross-cutting change. Usually paired with a
  `suggested_fix` the user can confirm. Examples: redesign a data model, add a pagination strategy.
- **advisory** — Report-only, no code change. Examples: residual-risk notes, deployment considerations, a
  design asymmetry the PR improves but does not fully resolve.

## owner — who acts next (4 values)

- **review-fixer** — the in-skill fixer can own this when policy allows.
- **downstream-resolver** — turn it into residual work for later resolution.
- **human** — a person must make a judgment call before code changes continue.
- **release** — operational/rollout follow-up; do not auto-convert into code-fix work.

`review_consensus.consolidate_fix_requests` groups active, non-pre-existing, non-advisory findings only
when they share an owner, an `autofix_class`, and overlapping touched paths. Disjoint path sets stay
separate so Orchestrate can route them to different Work workers. The serialized request is:

```json
{
  "fix_id": "fix-<stable digest>",
  "finding_ids": ["F-12"],
  "autofix_class": "gated_auto",
  "owner": "review-fixer",
  "touched_paths": ["src/state.py", "tests/test_state.py"],
  "summary": "Rollback loses the prior state",
  "requires_verification": true
}
```

## suggested_fix rule

Propose a concrete minimal fix whenever any defensible code change is reachable from review context
(parallel patterns, framework conventions, the cited code itself). Imperfect information is not grounds for
omission: propose the most defensible default, **name the assumption you made**, and let the user override.
"I need <input> to commit" is a **soft punt** — the right question is "what change would I propose if I had
to choose now?" Omit only when there is genuinely no code-level change (the finding is a question, or the
resolution is purely organizational). A soft punt is the failure mode this field exists to prevent.

## pre_existing honesty

Set `pre_existing: true` when the issue lives in unchanged code the diff merely touched. Pre-existing
findings are reported in a separate informational table — do not blame this diff for old code, and do not
gate the PR on issues it did not introduce.

## evidence

At least one item, each grounded in the code: a snippet, a `file:line` reference, or a precise pattern
description. A finding without evidence is not a finding.

## Merge, sort, and stable numbering

1. **Fingerprint dedup** — fingerprint is `path:line:category`. When multiple lenses flag the same issue,
   merge into one finding and record cross-reviewer agreement in the Reviewer column.
2. **Conservative route on disagreement** — keep the most conservative `autofix_class`
   (`safe_auto -> gated_auto -> manual`, never the reverse without stronger evidence).
3. **Sort** by severity (P0 first) -> confidence anchor (descending) -> file -> line.
4. **Stable #s** — assign monotonically increasing finding numbers once, across the full set. Reuse the
   same # wherever a finding reappears (residual work, fixer routing). Never restart per section.

## Output and durable-artifact contract

**Interactive output:** lead with P-level findings grouped by severity, each a pipe-delimited table
(`# | File | Issue | Reviewer | Confidence | Route`, where Route is `<autofix_class> -> <owner>`); escape
literal `|` inside cells as `\|`. Then a Coverage section (suppressed count, residual risks, testing gaps)
and a blockquote naming the typed outcome, next action, and fix order.

**Programmatic / report-only output:** canonical `review_result.v2` JSON from
`ReviewResult.to_json()`. A human rendering may follow with findings grouped by `autofix_class`, but it
does not add another decision field. Programmatic mode writes zero files to reviewed code.

The top-level serialized contract is:

```json
{
  "schema": "review_result.v2",
  "collection_operation": {"operation": "collect", "schema": "review_result.v2"},
  "revision_binding": {
    "best_available_revision": "<commit>",
    "lens_revisions": {"correctness": "<commit>"}
  },
  "selected_lenses": ["correctness"],
  "attempted_lenses": ["correctness"],
  "lens_results": [],
  "findings": [],
  "cycle_history": [],
  "failing_lenses": [],
  "fix_requests": [],
  "unresolved_fix_ids": [],
  "best_available_revision": "<commit>",
  "residual_summary": {
    "final_lens_scores": {},
    "unresolved_fix_ids": [],
    "score_regressions": [],
    "review_incomplete_reason": null
  },
  "outcome": "accepted",
  "next_action": "continue",
  "resume_transitions": ["continue"],
  "evidence_ledger": {},
  "external_advisory_reviews": []
}
```

`outcome` is exactly one of `accepted`, `repairs_requested`, `cycle_cap_best_available`, or
`review_incomplete`. It is the sole decision field. Each outcome names exactly one allowed resume
transition; `ReviewResult.require_resume_transition()` rejects any other value. Priority and
confidence never change the outcome.

**Durable artifact** — one `review_result.v2` entry in the run record's `review_cycles`, written by
`review_result.py`. It carries the reviewed revision in full, the roster hash, the per-lens results
with their thresholds and executors, the findings, the repair accounting, and the residual issue
numbers when the cycle cap was reached. Every later step of the run reads the run record already, so
the evidence lands where the next reader is looking rather than in a second store of its own.

## The fingerprint, and what it deliberately excludes

A finding's identity is the lifecycle catalogue's fingerprint of **path, line and category**, stable
across every cycle of the run, so the same defect keeps one identity however many lenses report it.

Wording is **not** part of it. Two findings worded alike are not thereby the same defect, and folding
them together on wording would merge two real problems into one repair — after which the second is
never fixed. Two reviewers reporting the same defect produce **one** finding with the agreement
recorded; the duplicate is kept as `duplicate-of` the survivor, visible and counted once.

## Status vocabulary

The catalogue's eight values, and no others: `open`, `fixed-verified`, `unresolved`, `disputed`,
`out-of-scope`, `evidence-gap`, `withdrawn`, `duplicate-of`.

A withdrawn finding stays visible with its disposition — withdrawing a finding is not a successful
repair. A repair whose evidence is insufficient is `unresolved`, never `fixed-verified`.

## What was removed here, and why

The whole-diff external advisory seat and its claim lifecycle are gone (issue 1001). They were a
narrower legacy path than the operator's session-based reviewer model, and the vocabulary they
carried — `recommended | requested | available | unavailable | declined`, `intent: second-opinion`,
`role_kind: advisory-reviewer` — described machinery with no caller left in this skill.

The `evidence_ledger.py` write is gone from this skill too. The evidence now lands in the run
record's `review_cycles`, which is where every other step of the run already reads. The ledger module
itself stays: it has other callers, and only this skill's call site went.

Removing Work's own in-process second-opinion offer and its private dispatch, sidecar, streak and
state modules is **issue 938**, not this card — those files are not in issue 1001's list, and nothing
goes that a card does not name.
