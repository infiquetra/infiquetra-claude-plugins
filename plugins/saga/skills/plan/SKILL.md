description: Create durable Infiquetra implementation plans with issue, review, test, and deploy gates. Interrogates HOW work gets built, writes an agent-consumable plan artifact, records a plan saga, and routes to doc-review and /work. Triggers on "plan this", "how should we build this", "create a plan", "break this down", or a handoff issue ready for planning.

# Plan

`/plan` answers **"How should it be built?"** It takes a settled WHAT — from `/brainstorm`'s
requirements doc, a handoff issue, or a clear ad-hoc request — and interrogates it into a durable,
agent-consumable implementation plan. It does **not** invent product behavior (that came from
`/brainstorm` or the issue), it does **not** implement code, and it does **not** run the review
gauntlet. It plans, self-reviews, records a plan saga, and routes.

## Position in the lifecycle

`/plan` sits between requirements and execution:

- `/office-hours` answers: "What is even the right frame?"
- `/ideate` answers: "What are the strongest ideas worth exploring?"
- `/brainstorm` answers: "What exactly should one chosen idea mean?" (the WHAT)
- **`/plan` answers: "How should it be built?"** (the HOW — this engine)
- the `review` phase (`/doc-review`) answers: "Is this plan ready to execute?"
- `/work` answers: "Build it." (consumes the plan + saga)

The handshake is deliberate. When the WHAT is unsettled, `/plan` recommends the operator step back to
`/brainstorm` first (a one-way forward route — `/plan` points there; it does not claim `/brainstorm`
"accepts" a handoff). When the plan is written, `/plan` recommends `/doc-review` (the review phase)
before `/work`.

## Core principles

1. **Decisions, not code.** Capture approach, boundaries, files, dependencies, risks, and per-unit
   test scenarios. Do not pre-write implementation code or shell-command choreography. Pseudo-code and
   DSL grammars are allowed only as explicitly directional high-level design, never as implementation
   specification.
2. **Ground before asking.** Read the code before you ask a question its answer is already in. Cite
   `path:line`. Quantify everything — "several files" is a bug; find the exact count. Never guess about
   the codebase; go read it.
3. **Agent-consumable plans.** The plan must let an unfamiliar implementer (human or `/work`) start
   confidently without re-asking the operator. Stable IDs (R-IDs, KTDs, U-IDs), per-unit test
   scenarios with repo-relative test-file paths, dependency-ordered units.
4. **Right-size via the warranted-gate.** Not every invocation produces a plan doc. Genuinely atomic
   work skips the artifact. But stress-test the "looks atomic" case — most requests hide KTDs.
5. **HOW-only.** Assume the WHAT arrived from `/brainstorm` or the issue. Do not re-litigate product
   scope, actors, or success criteria here — carry them forward as constraints.

## Interaction method

Use `AskUserQuestion` for choices from a known set (destination, execution backend, scope class,
resume-vs-mint). Call `ToolSearch` with `select:AskUserQuestion` first if its schema is not loaded.
Ask one question per turn; prefer a concise single-select when natural options exist. For open-ended
interrogation, ask inline in chat. Never silently skip a question.

In a channel session (`redis-channel` active), `AskUserQuestion` cannot be called — inline the choices
in your reply text instead. Follow the canonical channel-inline convention in
`saga/skills/brainstorm/SKILL.md` (do not duplicate its wording here).

Use repo-relative paths in every generated document. Absolute paths break portability across machines
and worktrees.

---

## Phase 0 — Enter and warranted-gate

Capture the input and decide whether a plan doc is even warranted before spending interrogation effort.

### 0.1 Capture input

The input is an issue reference, a requirements doc path, or an ad-hoc request. Take it from command
arguments or the active artifact. If empty, ask: "What would you like to plan? Point me at the
requirements doc, the issue, or describe the work." Do not proceed without one.

### 0.2 Issue handoff routing

If the input is a GitHub issue, run `scripts/parse_issue.py` and inspect the `handoff` object.

- For `idea-ready` or `requirements-ready` handoff issues, create or update a durable plan from the
  issue and its `Source context` / linked source. These are the maturities `/plan` consumes.
- For `plan-ready` or `resume-ready` handoff issues, tell the operator `/work <issue>` is the more
  direct consumer unless they explicitly want to re-plan. A plan already exists for these.

Use the issue's `Handoff maturity` and `Source context` sections as authoritative input.

### 0.3 Saga scan — offer resume before minting

Before minting a new plan saga, run `scan` to offer resuming an existing one (slug-instability
mitigation — a drifting task description would otherwise fork a second saga for the same work):

```bash
python3 plugins/saga/scripts/saga.py scan
```

If a candidate matches this thread (same `issue_ref`, or the operator confirms "resume this"), reuse
it — Phase 5 appends a tick rather than minting. For an issue whose `issue-<N>` directory is absent,
resolve via `state.json.sagas[*].issue_ref` ending in `#N` (the id is sticky; never rename the
directory). See `references/saga-spec.md` §2.3 and §2.1.

### 0.4 Warranted-gate — decide whether a plan doc is warranted

Bias toward producing a plan; the risk asymmetry favors writing one. **Skip the plan doc only when ALL
hold:** the work is atomic (fits one commit, no unit boundaries), there are no Key Technical Decisions
worth recording, no scope boundaries worth pinning, and no upstream artifact needs traceability.

**Stress-test the "looks atomic" case** — many requests look atomic but hide KTDs ("add caching" →
TTL / invalidation / key shape; "migrate A to B" → semantic-difference KTDs; "add rate limiting" →
algorithm / scope / configurability). See `references/plan-sections.md` ("Decide whether a plan doc is
warranted") for the full skip-vs-write rubric. When skipping, route directly to `/work` and let
decisions land in the commit message; otherwise continue.

### 0.5 Scope classification

Classify the work into one depth, which sizes the plan (Phase 3) and gates the deepening pass (Phase 4):

- **Lightweight** — small, well-bounded, low ambiguity. ~2-4 units. Omit optional sections.
- **Standard** — normal feature or bounded refactor with technical decisions to document. ~3-6 units.
- **Deep** — cross-cutting, strategic, high-risk, or highly ambiguous. ~4-8 units; optional analysis
  sections warranted.

If depth is unclear, ask one targeted question, then continue.

### 0.6 The card moves to Shaping — through Mission Control, not through this skill

**Saga does not write the board.** Mission Control is the only routine writer of the board's
`Stage` and `Status` fields; a Saga command that decided on its own that a card should move would
hold autonomous write authority over a field it no longer writes. What this skill owns is the
*durable state the move is derived from*: the plan artifact, the saga tick (`lifecycle_phase=plan`),
and the work-session path. Mission Control — the operator, or the run coordinator's board flow —
moves the card to Shaping from that derived state. Do not run a reconcile tick, a `flow set-field`
submission, or any other lifecycle-field write from here. When there is no issue, there is simply
no card to move; say nothing further.

## Phase 1 — Ground (HOW)

Read code before asking. This is the moment the operator sees you grounded in their actual repo, not a
generic checklist.

1. **Read the upstream artifact first.** If a `/brainstorm` requirements doc (`docs/brainstorms/*-requirements.md`),
   the handoff issue, or a linked source exists, read it thoroughly and carry forward its problem frame,
   requirements, scope boundaries, KTDs, and open questions as constraints the plan must honor.
2. **Read `STRATEGY.md`** if present and anchor plan decisions to the active tracks; flag any decision
   that pulls away from the stated approach.
3. **Read the engineering journal** (`docs/engineering-journal/`) for relevant prior LEARNINGS and
   DECISIONS so the plan follows established patterns instead of reinventing them.
4. **Quantify.** Find exact counts (files, call sites, tables). Cite `path:line` in your prose.
5. **Dispatch generic `Explore` agents in parallel** for grounding — repo patterns, relevant files,
   existing test conventions, adjacent implementations. Use the generic `Explore` agent; the `ce-*`
   research agents do **not** exist in this plugin.

**Cold-start (no upstream WHAT).** If there is no brainstorm doc, no issue, and the request is bare:
run a light Why-check (problem frame, intended behavior, obvious non-goals, success signal — keep it
brief; see `references/interrogation.md`). If the WHAT itself is unsettled — product framing, user
behavior, or scope is genuinely open — **recommend the operator run `/brainstorm` first** to settle
the WHAT, then return to `/plan`. This is a one-way forward route: point them there, offer to continue
planning with explicit assumptions if they decline, and do not claim `/brainstorm` "accepts" a handoff.

---

## Phase 2 — Interrogate (HOW)

**Load `references/interrogation.md`** and run the HOW-interrogation register against the grounded
evidence. Ambiguity is a bug; find it. The register covers:

- **Failure-mode enumeration** — for each unit, what happens when the input is empty, null, huge,
  duplicated, called by the wrong role, or called twice. Unenumerated failure modes are unwritten test
  scenarios.
- **Scope-lock** — lock what is explicitly out of scope early. When the operator opens a new front
  mid-plan, name it: "That's a separate issue — let's finish this one."
- **KTD-forcing** — surface the load-bearing technical decisions and force a choice with rationale.
  An open design fork the plan never resolves is a gap, not a decision.
- **Anti-premature-solution** — do not jump to implementation detail before the approach, boundaries,
  and failure modes are pinned.

Push on **vagueness** and **ungrounded assumptions** (not the operator's judgment): an undefined term,
a "several files" that should be a count, a behavioral assumption you have not verified in the code.
Push twice, then respect the answer. Escape hatches are in `references/interrogation.md`.

---

## Phase 3 — Synthesize the plan artifact

Write the plan to `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-plan.md` per `references/plan-sections.md`. Right-size
by the Phase-0.5 scope class. **Never code during this phase** — research, decide, and write the plan.

Follow the shared formatting contract in `saga/references/formatting-style.md` for the plan's visual
structure: lead each unit and major section with a one-line summary, keep narrative fields as short
(≤3-sentence) blank-line-separated prose, render comparative/scored data as a table, and never stack
bold labels without a blank line between them. Per-unit fields stay as blank-line-separated
`**label:**` lines under each `### U<N>.` heading (the contract's prose-heavy per-unit branch) — not a
table.

**Hard floor (every warranted plan carries these):**

- **Summary** — what the plan proposes, in 1-3 lines.
- **Problem Frame** — why the work is being done (may merge into Summary for compact plans).
- **Requirements** — with stable **R-IDs** (`R1.`, `R2.`); the reviewer's and `/work`'s checklist.
- **Key Technical Decisions** — the **KTDs**, each `<decision>: <rationale>`; the load-bearing choices
  that constrain implementation.
- **Implementation Units** — with stable **U-IDs** (`U1.`, `U2.`), each independently landable, with
  per-unit test scenarios and repo-relative test-file paths. Feature-bearing units require real test
  scenarios; only non-feature units (config, scaffolding) may use `Test expectation: none -- [reason]`.
- **Scope Boundaries** — what is explicitly out of scope, with `Deferred to Follow-Up Work` kept
  distinct from true non-goals.

**Deep adds (warranted only, never boilerplate):** High-Level Technical Design (HTD), Risk Analysis &
Mitigation, Alternatives Considered, Success Metrics. Include only when the content earns the section.

The plan must serve **three audiences**: the implementing agent (informed starting baseline), the
reviewer (load-bearing decisions in one pass), the future reader (why the work was done).

**Plan-doc frontmatter** (NOT the saga fields — those land in Phase 5):

```yaml
---
title: <verbatim plan title, matches the H1>
type: <feat|fix|refactor|chore|docs|perf|test>
status: active
date: YYYY-MM-DD
origin: <repo-relative path to the upstream brainstorm/requirements doc, when planning from one>
---
```

`origin:` MUST be emitted so the review phase can trace the plan back to its source. The body MUST use
the exact section markers `Implementation Units`, `Key Technical Decisions`, and the `U1` U-ID prefix —
`/doc-review` parses these to recognize the document as a plan.

**Record the KTDs to the engineering journal** (`docs/engineering-journal/DECISIONS.md`) — the journal
is the canonical decision record; the saga's `## Decisions` mirrors it.

---

## Phase 4 — Deepen (condensed confidence pass, conditional)

After writing the plan, evaluate whether it needs strengthening. The condensed confidence-pass rubric
lives in the **Confidence pass (deepening)** section of `references/plan-sections.md` — per-section gap
checklist, risk-weighted "is this plan thin?" scoring, and the top-N section cap.

- **Auto-run** for Deep plans, high-risk topics (auth, payments, data migration, external APIs,
  privacy), or thin grounding (Phase 1 found fewer than ~3 local patterns for what the plan needs).
- **Skip** for Lightweight, well-grounded plans — report "Confidence check passed" and continue.

When deepening, dispatch generic `Explore` / `Task` agents (not `ce-*` agents) at the top-scoring
sections only. Strengthen rationale, sequencing, test scenarios, and risk treatment in place. **Never
renumber existing U-IDs** when reordering or splitting units (the most likely accidental-renumber
vector). Add `deepened: YYYY-MM-DD` to frontmatter when the plan was substantively improved.

---

## Phase 5 — Saga, route, and operator-choice

### 5.0 The card moves to Ready — through Mission Control, not through this skill

The plan exists and is committed, so the card is no longer being shaped -- it is ready to build.

**Saga does not write the board.** As in Phase 0.6, the `Status → Ready` move belongs to Mission
Control, derived from what this skill durably produced: the committed plan, the saga tick, and the
work-session path. Do not run a reconcile tick, a `flow set-field` submission, or any other
lifecycle-field write from here. When there is no issue, there is no card to move; say nothing
further.

### 5.1 Ask the destination

Ask the routing intent (`AskUserQuestion`, or channel-inline): **plan-only / pr / merge /
nonprod-deploy**. This becomes the saga `--destination`.

**Deploy-autonomy follow-up (only when destination is `nonprod-deploy`).** When — and only when —
the operator picks `nonprod-deploy`, ask one more question (`AskUserQuestion`, or channel-inline) to
capture the gate-or-auto posture at the saga→deploy edge (issue #395, KTD3). Skip this question for
every other destination.

> **When a merged item reaches deploy, should nonprod promotion happen automatically, or wait for
> your explicit confirmation each time?**
> **A) Gate** (default, pre-select) — deploy asks for explicit confirmation before promoting.
> **B) Auto** — deploy may auto-promote to **nonprod only** (staging/production always confirm).

This becomes the saga `--deploy-autonomy <gate|auto>`. It is authored **once** here and read — never
re-asked — by `deploy_handoff.offer` at handoff time; there is deliberately no way to widen it to
`auto` at deploy time. **Pre-select Gate**: a missing or gate posture can never auto-fire, which is
the safe failure direction (R5). Omit `--deploy-autonomy` entirely for any non-deploy destination —
`deploy_handoff` reads an absent posture as `gate`.

### 5.2 Offer the execution backend

**Write the answer into the plan document's `backend:` frontmatter field**, not only into the saga
tick. The tick is untracked local state: it does not survive a worktree boundary, another machine,
or another vendor, so an executor that did not run in this directory cannot see it. The plan document
is committed and travels with the work, which makes it the only place a decision made here can
reliably be read later. `/work` honours that field and does not ask again.

The recorded enum still has three values — `inline` ("inline") | `team-execution` ("team execution") |
`cc-workflows-ultracode` ("dynamic workflows") — matching `references/operator-choice.md` and
`ORCHESTRATION_MODES`. **The default Saga offer is only `inline` and `team-execution`.** Claude Code
Workflows (`cc-workflows-ultracode`) remain only an **explicitly invoked** task-local mechanism inside
a Herdr-managed Claude Code session: never a default or automatic Saga backend, never a generic
interchangeable execution backend (DECISIONS `{#cc-workflows-backend-narrow-808}`, issue #808 NARROW
ruling). Never pre-select `cc-workflows-ultracode`. Never launch a Workflow because
`recommend_execution_backend()` returned it. Never silently substitute a Workflow for `inline` or
`team-execution`. Do not build a mechanism-neutral backend-switching abstraction around it.

Offer the default Saga backends per `references/operator-choice.md` (the decision contract, as
narrowed by #808). Read the work shape, **recommend the cheapest-correct Saga backend** (`inline` or
`team-execution`) and pre-select it. Call `lifecycle_state.recommend_execution_backend` so the tick
can record `--orchestration-recommended` (R12 telemetry). If `recommended` is `cc-workflows-ultracode`,
**do not pre-select** it — pre-select `team-execution` when a gated size/risk/consensus trigger fired,
otherwise `inline`. Confirm with the operator and record what they picked via `--orchestration-mode`.

**Before an explicit Workflow invocation, probe Workflow-tool availability with `ToolSearch`** (not
an assumption) and pass the result as `--workflow-availability-source probed`; only fall back to the
`asserted` default when a live probe is not possible on this host (e.g. a non-Claude-Code runner). The
recommender echoes the source back in `workflow_availability` so the offer can say whether
availability was verified or merely assumed. An unavailable Workflow is **not** a third interchangeable
choice; name it only to explain that explicit invocation cannot run here.

**Claude Code Workflows still serve the five workflow shapes** (per `references/operator-choice.md`
§3.2) — **understand / design / research / review / migrate** — and the two legacy purposes beside
them. Those purposes describe **when an operator might explicitly invoke** a Workflow. They are **not**
automatic offer triggers and **not** a reason to pre-select `cc-workflows-ultracode`:

- **Breadth / scale** (`broad_independent_fanout`) — broad independent fan-out, the same operation
  across many enumerated targets, or an exhaustive probe-all sweep where missing a target is the
  failure mode.
- **Adversarial confidence** (`adversarial_confidence`) — a judge panel over N independent attempts,
  prove-by-refutation (refute-N), or perspective-diverse verifiers each applying a distinct lens. This
  is real review depth; the Workflow tool names *confidence* as a first-class purpose. Set it only on an
  **explicit** request for many-independent-attempt verification, not on a generic "be more sure." (The
  `review` shape covers a multi-lens review *sweep* requested as a workflow; the explicit refute-N /
  judge-panel form stays `adversarial_confidence` — the two may co-fire, no precedence between them.)

Pass any matching shape(s) via repeatable `--workflow-shape` when authoring a spec after explicit
invocation; an unrecognized shape is rejected loud (`ValueError`), never silently downgraded to inline.

**The team↔workflow fork is GOVERNANCE, not "review depth"** (both have review depth). The question is:
**does the verdict need to stick?** Escalate to `team-execution` ("team execution") when the work needs
**gated** consensus — a verdict that blocks a merge/deploy and persists as standing evidence (a reviewer-
CONSENSUS gate, named scanners, a guarded deploy), or the size/risk signals fire (≥8 functional files,
≥4 phases, security, infra, cross-repo, deployment-sensitive). When the consensus signal is **advisory**
— N throwaway in-session votes you act on yourself, nothing recorded or blocking — stay on `inline`
unless the operator **explicitly invokes** a Claude Code Workflow judge-panel. Confirm with the operator
and record what they picked via `--orchestration-mode`. Enter §5.2a only after that explicit invocation.

**KTD4 — the gated-vs-advisory interrogation (R7).** When a consensus / multi-reviewer / many-attempt
signal is present, do **not** silently force `team-execution`. Ask the operator (`AskUserQuestion`, or
channel-inline) one question, with the work-shape default pre-selected:

> **Does this verdict need to BLOCK a merge/deploy or PERSIST as evidence — or are these throwaway
> in-session votes you act on yourself?**
> **A) Gated** — block/persist (a reviewer-CONSENSUS gate, named scanners, a guarded deploy) → `team-execution`.
> **B) Advisory** — N throwaway votes, nothing recorded/blocking → `inline` (a judge-panel Workflow
> only if the operator then explicitly invokes `cc-workflows-ultracode`).

**Work-shape default:** pre-select **Gated** when any deploy / security / persist signal is present
(`--destination merge|nonprod-deploy`, security/infra work, or a verdict that must be recorded); pre-select
**Advisory** otherwise. Pass the answer into the recommender as `--advisory-consensus` (set for B; omit for
A — gated is the default). Advisory consensus no longer auto-routes onto `cc-workflows-ultracode`; the
default Saga path is `inline`, and a Workflow judge-panel is explicit-invocation only. If the work is
**both** gated **and** broadly parallel, the default offer is still `team-execution` (and `inline` as
the cheaper alternative), not a third interchangeable Workflow choice.

#### 5.2a Author the ExecutionSpec (cc-workflows-ultracode only)

**Enter this section only after explicit invocation** — the operator named `cc-workflows-ultracode` in
this session, or a prior operator decision already recorded it. Never enter it because the recommender
suggested it, never as a silent substitute for `inline` or `team-execution`.

When the operator **explicitly invokes** `cc-workflows-ultracode`, **author a structured `ExecutionSpec`
before writing the saga tick**. This is the canonical artifact `/work` re-emits from; the spec JSON —
not the prose plan — is the single source of truth (KTD1, `references/operator-choice.md` §6).

**Step 1 — Derive per-unit tiers.** For each Implementation Unit in the plan, assign a `{model, effort}`
tier from the work-shape heuristic (R10). Surface the tier table for operator override before locking:

<!-- BEGIN GENERATED TIER TABLE (rendered from tier_policy.json via render_tier_table.py — do not hand-edit; a seeded divergence fails tests/test_tier_resolver.py::test_skill_registry_sync) -->
| Work shape | Default tier | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Judgment, design, adversarial review, architectural decisions | `opus / high` | Judgment, design, adversarial review, architectural decisions — deep reasoning needed; cost-justified. |
| Mechanical, deterministic, scripted transforms, scaffolding | `sonnet / medium` (or `haiku / low` for purely mechanical) | Mechanical, deterministic, scripted transforms, scaffolding — bounded output, predictable steps.; Purely mechanical work within the mechanical work-shape — cheapest tier still safe for bounded, predictable steps. |
| Read-only survey, search, grep, sampling, census | `sonnet / low` | Read-only survey, search, grep, sampling, census — low-effort read, no write risk. |
| External-engine delegation, `intent=offload`, `verifiability=test-gated` (ratify-only) | `haiku / low` | External-engine delegation, intent=offload, verifiability=test-gated — chaperone ratifies the declared test oracle and provenance; keep the chaperone cheap unless evidence size escalates. |
| External-engine delegation, `intent=offload`, `verifiability=unverifiable` or absent | `sonnet / medium` | External-engine delegation, intent=offload, verifiability=unverifiable or absent — chaperone performs full review; a heavier default would erase the token savings that motivated delegation (KTD2). |
| External-engine delegation, `intent=second-opinion` (U12) | `opus / high` | External-engine delegation, intent=second-opinion — adversarial verification IS the product; extra spend assumed; fable/xhigh available as a per-unit override, never a default (KTD2). |
| External-engine delegation, `intent=divergence` (adversarial review) | `opus / high` | External-engine delegation, intent=divergence — agreement and disagreement are both explicit adversarial-review outcomes; use the high-tier chaperone posture. |
<!-- END GENERATED TIER TABLE -->

Apply the heuristic per unit, then present the full tier table (U-ID, label, proposed tier, rationale)
and ask the operator to confirm or override before proceeding. Do not lock tiers silently.

**Run-start posture seeds the defaults (#380).** When the run carries a committed intent envelope
(`ExecutionSpec.intent`, or the parent outcome's `OutcomeSpec.intent` — see
`plugins/saga/references/intent-envelope.md`), derive each unit's PROPOSED tier through
`intent_envelope.seeded_tier(spec, work_shape)` (equivalently `intent_envelope.py recommend
--work-shape <shape> --run-mode <mode>`): the posture was asked ONCE at run start, and an
unattended posture proposes one rung cheaper than the attended default for the same work shape.
This changes only the table's proposed defaults — the table itself, the operator-override flow,
and the `VERIFY_N_CAP` mechanics are unchanged, and no per-unit posture question is ever asked
(the fleet drift guard fails on one).

**Estimate column (#402).** Add a fourth `Estimate` column to this per-plan table (the U-ID/label/
tier/rationale table above, never the GENERATED work-shape registry table) — the ordinal, index-weighted
spend the assigned tier costs (never a dollar amount). Once the per-unit tiers are locked into a draft
`ExecutionSpec`, run

```bash
python3 plugins/saga/scripts/spend_estimate.py estimate --spec <spec.json>
```

and fold its per-unit figures into the Estimate column so the operator sees relative cost alongside the
tier they are confirming, not as a separate lookup. The estimator is read-only (it renders a table; it
writes nothing to the ledger or the spec) — see `spend_estimate.py`'s own module docstring for the
reconcile-side (post-run) companion this authoring-time render feeds into.

**The `/plan`-authored tier table is not the only lever (#365).** The operator can adjust tier
**mid-run** without aborting and re-planning via `/tier`: a run-scoped ceiling
(`.claude/saga/tier-session-override.json`) that the emitters clamp every unit down to, or a mid-run
patch of a not-yet-run unit's tier that re-validates and re-emits the spec. The authored table is the
starting point; `/tier` is the live adjustment. A ceiling only ever clamps down, and an up-ladder
mid-run change is gated (asks) before it re-emits.

**Persisted tier preferences (#368).** Before deriving cold from the registry table above, resolve
each work-shape through `scripts/tier_defaults.py` — precedence is **repo overlay > issue band >
shared registry**:

1. **Repo overlay** — a committed `.saga/tier-defaults.json` (`{"<work-shape>": {"model", "effort"}}`)
   pins repo-tuned defaults. `resolve_tier_with_overlay(work_shape)` returns the pinned tier when
   present. Missing file → clean registry fallback; malformed (bad JSON, unknown shape, off-palette or
   unrunnable tier) → `TierDefaultsError`, halt and surface (never degrade silently).
2. **Issue band** — when the driving issue carries a `### Recommended Tier Band` section
   (auto-stamped by `mission-control:issue` at creation), parse it with `parse_tier_band(body)` and
   pass it to `resolve_tier_for_plan(work_shape, issue_band=band)`. The band seeds the proposed tier
   only where no repo override exists; an absent band is normal (`None`), a present-but-invalid one
   fails loud.
3. **Write-back** — when the operator confirms a tier override in the Step 1 table, persist it with
   `write_tier_default(work_shape, model, effort)` so the next `/plan` proposes the accreted
   preference. Read-merge-write: never clobbers other keys. The file is **tracked** — commit the
   dirtied overlay with the run's changes (the repo accretes tier judgment). Every persisted override
   originates from an explicit operator confirmation; never auto-promote silently.

<!-- EFFORT-EMISSION MARKER (#362 U5, R7, KTD6): the per-unit "proposed tier" cell is a
`<model>/<effort>` pair — both fields sourced verbatim from `tier_resolver.resolve(...).model`
and `.effort`, never a bare model literal with effort omitted. This is emission only: /plan
surfaces the resolver's effort so the operator can see and override it before locking, but no
dispatch mechanism honors it yet (that's #363's `EFFORT_RIDER`/cascade). Team-execution's own
A7 worker table (`plugins/team-execution/skills/team-execution/SKILL.md`) carries the same
`<model>/<effort>` cell shape for the identical reason — see its Tier column note. -->

For a unit carrying `engine`/`capability` (U12 chaperone-worker units), the recommendation row also
carries the unit's `intent` and a **plan-time resolution preview**: for a capability-routed unit, call
`engine_resolver.resolve({"role_kind": "worker", "capability": <value>}, mode="advisory", registry=…)`
(`mode="advisory"` — R7 — since this is a non-binding preview, not the run-time dispatch) and surface
"resolves today to `<engine_id>/<variant>`" alongside the tier row; an explicit-engine unit has no
preview to show (naming the engine already fixes it — R26 halts rather than substitutes if it becomes
unavailable). This preview is the baseline the chaperone's `substituted-engine` disposition compares
the run-time resolution against (KTD4, `references/external-engine-workers.md` §4 in team-execution) —
record it in the saga tick / emitted plan alongside the tier so it survives to `/work`.

**Step 1b — Price the plan and set the spend guards (#366).** Once tiers are locked the plan has a
*price*: surface it and set the run-scoped guards before authoring prompts.

- Run `python3 plugins/saga/scripts/execution_spec.py spend <spec.json>` to print per-unit spend, the
  multiplicity-aware total (fan-out targets and verify panels counted, not one weight per unit), any
  `cost_budget` headroom, and the `spend_envelope`. Show the operator the priced plan.
- Set an optional `cost_budget` on the spec when the operator wants a hard ceiling — `validate`/`emit`
  HALT (never a silent over-spend, per HALT-not-degrade) if the summed spend exceeds it, mirroring
  `VERIFY_N_CAP`.
- Set an optional `spend_envelope` when the operator wants "ask once, at the crossing" rather than a
  prompt per expensive choice; `/work`'s #364 between-rounds escalation consults it before proposing a
  climb (`SpendEnvelope.consider`).
- Author per-unit effort allocations with
  `python3 plugins/saga/scripts/effort_ledger.py allocate --unit <U-ID> --amount <to_spend>` (ordinal
  spend units, so escrow and the budget speak one currency). `/work` records actuals and refunds unused
  budget; a unit that would exceed its allocation surfaces an escalation-request **before** it runs.

Weights are ordinal/relative, not dollar prices — the cost-weighted spend-*delta* classifier is #367.

**Step 1c — Spend-delta levers: relative override, worth-it receipts, spend authority (#367).**

- **Relative override** — when the operator wants to adjust a proposed tier, offer the three-way
  **relative** choice `cheaper` / `as-proposed` / `dearer` (computed by `execution_spec.adjacent_tier`)
  instead of forcing an absolute re-pick from the full `MODELS × EFFORTS` enum. `cheaper`/`dearer` step
  exactly one rung; at a ladder boundary the lever raises (no silent clamp). `spend_delta(old, new)`
  classifies any change as `cheapen` / `escalate` / `lateral` — a `lateral` (sideways axis trade) or a
  `cheapen` proceeds quietly; an `escalate` is the one that asks.
- **Worth-it receipts** — a **premium** tier (opus/fable model or xhigh effort — above the `sonnet/high`
  baseline) must carry a one-line `worth_it_because` and a named `cheaper_fallback` (an adjacent
  strictly-cheaper tier, default `adjacent_tier(tier, "cheaper")`). Enforce it at authoring by validating
  with receipts required:
  `python3 plugins/saga/scripts/execution_spec.py validate <spec.json> --require-receipts`. Plain
  `validate`/`emit` do NOT require receipts, so existing specs are never retroactively broken.
- **Spend authority** — resolve each unit's silent/ask disposition via
  `spend_authority.resolve_spend_authority(tier)`: a `.saga/spend-authority.json` `silent_ceiling`
  (absent → `sonnet/high`) makes any premium tier `ask` and everything at/below `silent` — the
  configurable home for the cheap-silent/expensive-asks rule.

**Step 2 — Author thin per-unit prompts (KTD2).** Each unit's prompt is a **thin pointer**, not a prose
transcription of the plan:

```
<unit-id>: <one-line goal>. Read the plan at <repo-relative plan path> as your authoritative spec.
```

The emitter appends fan-out reconciliation, budget riders, and return contracts automatically — do not
duplicate them in the prompt. Depth comes from the agent reading the plan; the prompt is control flow.

**Step 3 — Wire depends_on barriers and optional verify panels.** Set `depends_on` from the plan's
dependency order. For units with an **explicit** adversarial-confidence request, add a `verify` panel:
default `n=3`, `pass_rule=majority` (KTD3 — a finding survives unless ≥⌈3/2⌉=2 of 3 verifiers refute
it). Override N per-unit when the operator requests a different panel size; N is capped at 7
(VERIFY_N_CAP) — above the cap, `validate` will hard-block.

**Step 4 — Validate the spec (HARD BLOCK on failure).** Run the validator:

```bash
python3 plugins/saga/scripts/execution_spec.py validate docs/plans/<name>-spec.json
```

A non-zero exit means the spec is malformed. **Do NOT proceed to emit or persist an invalid spec** — fix
the `SpecError` and re-validate. Common failures: `depends_on` cycle, fan-out unit with no `targets`,
pilot tier mismatch (R3), N above VERIFY_N_CAP.

**Step 5 — Emit the workflow script and surface for operator confirmation.** Once `validate` exits 0:

```bash
python3 plugins/saga/scripts/execution_spec.py emit docs/plans/<name>-spec.json \
  -o docs/plans/<name>.workflow.js
```

**Then render the approval table — this is the artifact the operator approves, not the JSON:**

```bash
python3 plugins/saga/scripts/spec_table.py docs/plans/<name>-spec.json --backend <backend>
```

Paste that table into your reply verbatim. It reports every unit's tier, the dependency waves
(what actually runs in parallel), spend against budget, and — the decision-relevant part — **what
the chosen backend can and cannot enforce**. A spec declaring a restrictive sandbox axis the
backend cannot enforce will HALT at emit rather than silently downgrade, and the table says so
*before* the operator approves rather than after the run fails.

Do **not** hand-build this table, and do **not** dump the spec JSON instead. Never ask an operator
to approve a backend without showing its enforceability rows: `cc-workflows-ultracode` enforces
read-only and disposable-worktree and reaches every model; `team-execution` enforces neither axis
and cannot reach `fable`. That asymmetry is invisible in the spec itself.

**Split the work so concurrent units never share a file (#671).** The table's
*Concurrent-writer safety* section reports any two units that would run in the same wave while
declaring the same path, and `emit` HALTs on one — no backend can enforce its way out of a
collision, because concurrent agents share one working tree and Claude Code has no cross-agent file
lock. Get this right while authoring the units, not at emit:

- Different repositories, or disjoint files → safe to run in parallel.
- Same file → **one unit**, not two. Merging beats sequencing: a single agent making both edits
  keeps the file's context warm and reuses the prompt cache, where splitting pays to load the same
  file into two agents and then risks losing one of their writes.
- Only reach for `depends_on` when the two really are separate pieces of work that happen to touch
  a shared path.

Bias toward fewer, longer-lived units generally. Parallel width is not free — it costs cache
reuse, and the fleet's own history is 88 of 92 waves running a single unit.

The operator must explicitly confirm the tier assignments and the control-flow structure before
`/work` runs it (R8 "approved"). A rejection means revising the spec and re-running validate +
emit + table.

**Spec naming convention:** `docs/plans/<YYYY-MM-DD>-<topic>-spec.json` beside the plan doc. The
`.workflow.js` shares the same stem: `docs/plans/<YYYY-MM-DD>-<topic>.workflow.js`.

### 5.3 Write the saga tick

Emit a **runnable** saga `save` command — never prose like "write a saga", and never `git add` the
tick (saga state is git-ignored, machine-local). Use the real flags:

```bash
python3 plugins/saga/scripts/saga.py save \
  --kind <issue|task> \
  --id <issue-number-or-task-slug> \
  --lifecycle-phase plan \
  --plan-path docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-plan.md \
  --destination <plan-only|pr|merge|nonprod-deploy> \
  --deploy-autonomy <gate|auto>   # ONLY when --destination nonprod-deploy (Phase 5.1); else omit \
  --adr-refs "ADR-NNNN|ADR-MMMM" \
  --decisions "KTD1: rationale. KTD2: rationale." \
  --orchestration-mode <inline|team-execution|cc-workflows-ultracode> \
  --orchestration-recommended <recommend_execution_backend() output>
```

**For `cc-workflows-ultracode`:** also pass `--orchestration-ref` pointing at the **spec JSON** (the
canonical artifact, per KTD1/KD3 — regenerable, so the ref is the spec not the `.workflow.js`):

```bash
python3 plugins/saga/scripts/saga.py save \
  --kind <issue|task> \
  --id <issue-number-or-task-slug> \
  --lifecycle-phase plan \
  --plan-path docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-plan.md \
  --destination <plan-only|pr|merge|nonprod-deploy> \
  --adr-refs "ADR-NNNN|ADR-MMMM" \
  --decisions "KTD1: rationale. KTD2: rationale." \
  --orchestration-mode cc-workflows-ultracode \
  --orchestration-recommended <recommend_execution_backend() output> \
  --orchestration-ref docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-spec.json
```

The `.workflow.js` is regenerable at any time from the spec (`execution_spec.py emit`); the spec JSON is
the durable canonical artifact. `orchestration_ref` is the repo-relative path to the spec JSON, so
`/work` can re-emit fresh without any prose-parsing.

Also pass `--orchestration-recommended <the backend the recommender suggested>` so the tick records
recommended-vs-chosen on this decision (R12 override-rate telemetry); `orchestration_operator_choice`
auto-derives from `--orchestration-mode`, so the only added burden is naming the recommendation.

`--id` is the only strictly required flag (`--kind` defaults to `issue`); for ad-hoc work pass
`--kind task --id <slug>`. `--lifecycle-phase plan`, `--plan-path`, `--destination`,
`--deploy-autonomy` (only when `--destination nonprod-deploy` — Phase 5.1), `--adr-refs`,
`--decisions` (the KTD mirror), `--orchestration-mode`, `--orchestration-recommended`, and (for
ultracode) `--orchestration-ref` carry the `/plan` consumer row from `references/saga-spec.md` §11.
When resuming (Phase 0.3 matched), this appends a tick to the existing saga directory rather than
minting a new one.

### 5.4 Route

Recommend the next command with plural clean exits:

- **`/doc-review`** (recommended next) — the review phase. `/work` gates on doc-review and blocks on
  unresolved P0/P1 findings, so run the review before execution.
- **`/work`** — execute the plan (after doc-review).
- **`/handoff`** — hand the plan to an SDLC issue through `mission-control`.
- **`/brainstorm`** — step back if interrogation revealed the WHAT was not actually settled.

### 5.5 Hard boundary

`/plan` authors a plan artifact and self-reviews it. It does **NOT** implement code, does **NOT** file
SDLC issues (`mission-control` owns issue creation), and does **NOT** run the full review gauntlet
(`/doc-review` owns that). Plan, write the saga, route — then stop.
