description: Run the build loop for a settled Infiquetra plan. One worktree and branch per unit, implement, then run the written exit criterion from the run record — the mechanical baseline, the plan's functional checks, the branch preview where the repository declares one, and the scenario smoke — repeating until green, and hand the exact revision to /code-review. Restores and writes the work-thread saga (the primary writer). Triggers on "build it", "work this plan", "execute the plan", "resume work on #N", or a plan-ready / resume-ready handoff issue.

# Work

`/work` answers **"Build it."** It takes a settled plan — from `/plan`, a `plan-ready` / `resume-ready`
handoff issue, or an approved ad-hoc request — and runs the **build loop**: implement, run the
written exit criterion, repeat until green, hand the exact revision to `/code-review`. It does
**not** invent product behavior (that came from `/brainstorm` and the issue), it does **not** re-run
the plan interrogation (`/plan` settled the HOW), and it does **not** own deploy mutation (`deploy`
does).

**The finish line is written down before the first line of code, and it is read, not judged.** The
exit criterion lives in the run record, put there at admission and by the plan: the mechanical
baseline from the repository profile, the plan's child-scoped functional checks, a branch preview
deployment where the repository declares one, and the plan's scenario smoke. `/work` runs it with
`plugins/saga/scripts/build_loop.py` and repeats until every part is green. Its full contract — the
check map, the three statuses, the record block and the exit codes — is in
`plugins/saga/references/mechanical-baseline.md`.

**A failing check is a loop iteration, not a refusal.** Nothing in the loop blocks, stops, or asks
the operator. `build_loop.py` exits 4 to say "not green yet"; the answer is to implement again and
run it again. There is no risk-gated test judgment any more, and there is no ship ceremony: the
worker checks a fact rather than concluding one, and the merge turn belongs to the integrate step.

`/work` is the saga's **primary writer**: it `restore`s on resume, mints/advances the work-thread saga
to `lifecycle_phase=work`, writes a tick per phase, and — crucially — **mints the *findable* work-thread
saga** (with `issue_ref` / `plan_path` / branch set) that a standalone `/code-review` appends `review_paths`
to (saga-spec §11). For its own pre-PR gate, `/work` calls `/code-review` programmatically and reads the
returned envelope **directly** — programmatic mode hands persistence to the caller, so `/work` owns the
gate, not a saga round-trip.

## Position in the lifecycle

`/work` is the loop's execution hub — every real build runs through it:

- `/plan` answers: "How should it be built?" (writes the plan + a `lifecycle_phase=plan` saga)
- plan review (`/doc-review`) answers: "Is this plan ready to execute?" — dispatched by `/plan`
  Phase 5.4, not by the operator. (`review` is a declared `lifecycle_phase` in `scripts/saga.py`
  that no code path writes; plan review is a step inside the plan phase, not a recorded phase.)
- **`/work` answers: "Build it." — and owns the PR loop to merge** (this engine)
- `/code-review` answers: "Is the built code safe to merge?" (`/work` calls it programmatically for the gate; appends `review_paths` when run standalone against `/work`'s saga)
- `/qa` answers: "Does the shipped thing actually work?" (`/work` routes here advisorily after merge)

`/work` consumes what `/plan` produced (the plan doc + the plan saga) and advances that same saga
through `work`. It calls `/code-review` before opening a PR. After merge it routes to `/qa`
advisorily and leaves `lifecycle_phase=work`, because the advance to `qa` is **`/qa`'s to make and
only on a PASS** — on a FAIL `/qa` keeps the phase at `work` and records the evidence. So the saga
legitimately sits at `work` from merge until `/qa` runs and passes (see Phase 5).

## Core principles

1. **Build, don't re-decide.** `/work` executes a settled plan. It does not invent product behavior,
   re-run the plan interrogation, or renegotiate scope. The plan's Implementation Units define the work;
   honor `Scope Boundaries` and refer back when execution drifts toward adjacent work.
2. **The saga is the spine.** `restore` on resume (rehydrate `round`/`phase`/`checks_run`/`next_step`);
   write a tick per phase boundary; round-N is deterministic. `/work` is the **primary writer** and mints
   the saga with the identity keys (`issue_ref` / `plan_path` / branch) a standalone `/code-review` needs
   to find and append `review_paths` to. Never set `next_round` — it is derived (saga-spec §6.1).
3. **The exit criterion is written, and the loop reads it.** What a unit must clear was settled at
   admission and by the plan, and it sits in the run record where the worker can read it before
   writing a line. `/work` runs it, records every result, and repeats until green. It does not
   weigh whether the tests are adequate and it does not decide which change kinds deserve a gate —
   that judgment was the thing the written criterion replaced. Run the criterion against the merge
   base, not stale local state.
4. **Record the Saga backend.** `inline` is the only backend the recommender returns since issue
   #1030 archived team-execution, so there is no offer to render and nothing for the operator to
   pick between: call `recommend_execution_backend()` and record what it says, so the tick still
   carries recommended-and-chosen. `cc-workflows-ultracode` is never a default or automatic Saga
   backend and never a generic interchangeable execution backend (issue #808 NARROW); **never
   pre-select** it. Enter a Claude Code Workflow only
   by **explicit invocation** (plan `backend: cc-workflows-ultracode`, or the operator names it in
   this session). No silent substitute. The recorded value is what the operator picked.
5. **Coordinate the PR loop, mutate only under confirmation.** Offer PR-open, review-request, and merge
   — each an explicitly confirmed git/`gh` op, **never silent**. Deploy mutation routes to
   `deploy`; issue comments and board moves route to `mission-control`.
6. **Outcome-driven review gate, honest override.** Treat Code Review's typed `outcome` as the sole
   review-acceptance decision: `accepted` and `cycle_cap_best_available` may reach PR-ready;
   `repairs_requested` and `review_incomplete` block. Independently block a **stale** review (commits
   since the reviewed SHA). Finding Priority and confidence are metadata only, never another gate.
   Allow an explicit operator override only with a **recorded** rationale — never a silent skip.

## Interaction method

Use `AskUserQuestion` for choices from a known set (resume-vs-mint, branch decision, execution backend,
doc-review override, PR-open / merge confirmation, continuation routing). Call `ToolSearch` with
`select:AskUserQuestion` first if its schema is not loaded. Ask one question per turn; prefer a concise
single-select when natural options exist. For open-ended discussion, ask inline in chat. Never silently
skip a confirmation that mutates GitHub.

In a channel session (`redis-channel` active), `AskUserQuestion` cannot be called — inline the choices
in your reply text instead. Follow the canonical channel-inline convention in
`saga/skills/brainstorm/SKILL.md` (do not duplicate its wording here).

Use repo-relative paths in every generated document. Absolute paths break portability across machines
and worktrees. (The one exception is the saga `--review-paths` value passed through to `/code-review`,
which mirrors that skill's convention.)

## Role sessions: the roster helper

When a phase needs a role running as its own herdr session rather than as a subagent, stand it up
with agent-launcher's roster helper, never by assembling launcher calls by hand:

```bash
R=$(ls -d ~/.claude/plugins/cache/*/agent-launcher/*/skills/agent-launcher/scripts/roster.py \
    | sort -V | tail -1)
python3 "$R" up   --issue <N>            # one named pane per role in the run record's staffing plan
python3 "$R" wait --issue <N> --timeout 600000
python3 "$R" down --issue <N>            # closes only what that record says it created
```

It reads the run record's staffing plan, records every pane it creates in the record's `roster`
array, and closes nothing that array does not name. `down` is the only teardown; never close a role
pane by hand. A blocked role is reported, not answered. Every subcommand refuses outside a herdr
pane (exit 4), so run it from the coordinator's own pane. Its full contract is in the
agent-launcher skill under "A whole roster from a run record".

## Reviewer-session transport

Orchestrate owns reviewer-session transport. Do not run `engine_offer.py`, do not
launch `engine_session_runner.py`, and do not consult `engine-registry.yaml` as a
launch authority — it is capability metadata only. If this `/work` unit needs an external reviewer and that reviewer
is not already a named unit in the Orchestrate run record, HALT — do not invent a
custom review and do not fall back to the retired runner.

---

## Phase 0 — Enter, scan the saga, triage, detect round-N

Capture the input and decide the shape of the run before executing anything.

### 0.1 Capture input

The input is a plan path, a GitHub issue reference, or a resume request. Take it from command arguments
or the active artifact. If empty, ask: "What should I build? Point me at the plan doc, the issue, or say
'resume'." Do not proceed without one.

### 0.2 Issue handoff routing

If the input is a GitHub issue, run `scripts/parse_issue.py` and inspect the `handoff` object.

- For `plan-ready` or `resume-ready` handoff issues with plan-grade context (or a linked plan), proceed
  — these are the maturities `/work` consumes.
- For `idea-ready` or `requirements-ready` handoff issues, tell the operator `/plan <issue>` is the
  correct upstream step (no plan exists yet) unless they explicitly override the missing plan step.

Use the issue's `Handoff maturity`, `Source context`, and the parsed flags (`has_security`, `has_infra`,
`has_api`) as authoritative input — they feed the backend recommendation (Phase 1) and the hard test
gate (Phase 3). Pass `--flags` to widen those flags with a model judgment (widen-only: a keyword flag
stays set whatever the model answers, and a client failure returns the keyword result unchanged).

### 0.3 Saga scan — offer resume before minting

Before minting a new work-thread saga, run `scan` to offer resuming an existing one (slug-instability
mitigation — saga-spec §2.3):

```bash
python3 plugins/saga/scripts/saga.py scan
```

If a candidate matches this thread (same `issue_ref`, the same `plan_path`, or the operator confirms
"resume this"), `restore` it (next step). For an issue whose `issue-<N>` directory is absent, resolve via
`state.json.sagas[*].issue_ref` ending in `#N` (the id is sticky; never rename the directory —
saga-spec §2.1). A `/plan` run will usually have already minted this saga at `lifecycle_phase=plan`;
`/work` advances that same thread rather than forking a second one.

### 0.4 Round-N PR detection (re-entry)

If the matched/restored work-thread saga has a populated `pr_refs`, this is a **re-entry** into the
round-N PR loop, not a fresh build. Read the live PR state with a **total read**:

```bash
gh pr view <N> --json state,reviewDecision,mergeable,mergeStateStatus,statusCheckRollup,isDraft,mergedAt
```

Then run the total PR-state transition table in `references/pr-continuation-loop.md` (draft / await-review /
changes-requested / pending-or-failing-checks / conflicting / approved-stale / approved-fresh / merged /
closed). `/work` **owns this re-entry** — it does not depend on `/resume` being rebuilt. Round bumps go
through `--rounds-seen` (never `next_round`). Branches that re-execute units re-enter Phases 2-5 with the
round incremented; branches that merge or pause set `status`/`phase_status` and stop.

On a failure row, run the **between-rounds tier escalation proposal** (#364) in
`references/pr-continuation-loop.md` before re-executing: when the failure is depth-shaped, propose
exactly one `escalate_tier` rung with its ordinal cost delta, gated on operator confirmation
(end-clamped at the ladder top / session ceiling — never silently applied).

**Resolve the spend decision through the intent envelope (#380).** When the run carries a committed
run-start envelope (`spec.intent` — see `plugins/saga/references/intent-envelope.md`), the
escalation ask above resolves through the fleet posture registry, never an ad hoc question:
`python3 plugins/saga/scripts/intent_envelope.py spend --run-mode <mode> --spend-increase
[--approval-token <tok>]`. An attended spend increase needs the operator's explicit approval
token (the resolver raises `PostureError` without one); an unattended run holds at the
cache-tight default silently — record the held escalation in the round summary instead of
prompting.

### 0.5 Complexity triage

For a fresh build (no `pr_refs`), size the execution strategy with the CE complexity triage in
`references/execution-strategy.md` (trivial / small-medium / large). Trivial changes implement directly
with no task list; small/medium and large build a task list from the plan's Implementation Units. Large,
cross-cutting, or auth/payments/migration work that arrived as a bare prompt should bounce to `/plan`
first; honor the operator's choice if they proceed.

---

## Phase 1 — Setup, task list, backend

### 1.1 Read the plan and set up the branch

Read the plan document completely — treat it as a decision artifact, not an execution script. Use its
`Implementation Units`, `Key Technical Decisions`, `Requirements`, and per-unit `Test scenarios` as the
primary source material. **Do not edit the plan body during execution** — progress lives in git commits,
the task tracker, and the saga, not in plan-body checkboxes.

Decide the branch/worktree per `references/execution-strategy.md` (meaningful branch name; worktree when
parallel dispatch is warranted; never commit to the default branch without explicit confirmation).
**Save the saga while on the work branch** (Phase 1.4) so the cached `branch` is a reliable fallback for
`/code-review`'s match (saga-spec §1.1 — git is the authority, the cache is for offline match).

### 1.2 Build the task list from U-IDs

Build the task list from the plan's Implementation Units, **preserving each unit's U-ID as a task-subject
prefix** (e.g. "U3: add parser coverage") so blockers, deferred-work notes, and the final summary stay
anchored to the same identifiers the plan uses. Carry each unit's `Execution note`, `Patterns to follow`,
and `Verification` field. See `references/execution-strategy.md`.

### 1.3 Doc-review gate

<!-- gate-record: id=work-doc-review-floor absence=HALT transport=ask-user-question -->

Before executing from a plan, confirm the plan cleared plan review. `/plan` Phase 5.4 dispatches
that review and loops on repair, so by the time `/work` starts the result exists; this step reads
it, it does not ask whether to run it.

**Read the evidence in this order, and stop at the first that resolves:**

1. The run record's `review_cycles` at `<primary checkout>/.claude/saga/runs/issue-<N>.json` — the
   durable result, written by the loop that produced it, and readable from any worktree or
   session.
2. Same-session review output.
3. The latest matching artifact under `docs/reviews/`, resolved by the recorded target path per
   the doc-review skill's artifact-matching rule.

The order matters after a resume: chat memory is not durable evidence and a session that resumed
has none, which is exactly when a gate is most likely to be waved through on a recollection.

**If an unresolved `P0` or `P1` finding remains, block execution.** The only way past is the
operator explicitly overriding, in one word, with a rationale — recorded, and carried into the
Phase-4 issue comment via `--doc-review-override`. Nothing else produces an override: not a
finding count, not an exhausted cycle allowance, not unattended mode, and no sentence in this
skill. Do not reinterpret finding metadata to talk yourself past the block.

### 1.3b Submit the card's move to `Active` / `Implementing` — Mission Control executes it

Work is starting. Until the card moves, it reads exactly as it did before anyone picked it up,
which on a wide run means a card sitting untouched while several units build against it.

**Actor:** this skill. **Trigger:** work is starting for a real issue — the doc-review gate in
§1.3 has passed, the work branch exists, and the issue reference is known. **Move:** the live pair
`Stage` = `Active`, `Status` = `Implementing`.

**The trigger names only what exists at §1.3b.** An earlier form required "the saga tick minted
below, the work branch, and the work-session path" — the tick is minted in §1.4 and the work-session
writeup in Phase 4, so two of the three conditions are produced *after* the move they are supposed
to gate. An agent reading the section literally would defer the move to Phase 4 or skip it, leaving
the card in the previous stage for the whole of the work. A board move's trigger must be observable
at the point the move is made.

**Deciding and submitting is not writing.** Mission Control remains the only executor of a `Stage`
or `Status` write; this skill submits the move through the reconcile controller and composes no
write of its own:

```bash
python3 plugins/saga/scripts/reconcile_controller.py reconcile \
  --op set-field-status --repo <owner/repo> --number <N> \
  --target-state "Implementing" \
  --payload '{"assignments": [["Stage", "Active"], ["Status", "Implementing"]]}'
```

**Submit both halves, and check both.** The pair travels in one invocation but is not rolled back
if the second assignment fails. Read the record by the contract in "Reading a lifecycle record"
under Phase 4.4 — in particular, `field` must be `Stage+Status`, because `skipped` alone is not
proof the move happened and an installed saga older than the pair contract reports `written` after
writing the `Status` half only. `halt`/`gated` falls back to the operator-prompted Mission Control
path. Say in the phase header that work is starting.

When there is no issue, no board move is submitted — a unit with no card has no lifecycle field
to move, so this step is a no-op (not a silent skip of a required write).

### 1.4 Honour the plan's backend, then mint/advance the saga

**If the plan carries a `backend:` frontmatter field, honour it and do not offer.** Say in one line
which backend the plan chose, record it exactly as though the operator had picked it, and continue.
The decision was already made — at plan time, by this operator — and asking again is not a second
confirmation, it is the same question in a place where the answer may no longer be reachable: under
`/orchestrate` this runs in a background tab where an unanswered offer waits forever. Honouring
`backend: cc-workflows-ultracode` is honouring an **explicit invocation** already recorded on the
plan, not a default or automatic selection.

Offer only when the field is absent, which is every plan written before this contract existed.
The offer renders from `references/operator-choice.md` as narrowed by issue #808; the offer itself,
the runnable recommender call, and the rules that keep a Claude Code Workflow behind an explicit
invocation are in [`references/workflow-backend.md`](../../references/workflow-backend.md).

**The default offer is `inline`, and it is the only recommended backend.** The offer was `inline` or
`team-execution` until issue #1030 archived that plugin; what it provided -- reviewer consensus and
named scanners -- is now the lensed code review and the build loop's mechanical baseline, which an
inline run already performs. `cc-workflows-ultracode` is never a default or automatic backend and
never a generic interchangeable execution backend; **do not pre-select** it, and never silently
substitute it for `inline`.

Then mint/advance the work-thread saga to `lifecycle_phase=work`. Set `--issue-ref` (the issue case — the
saga-spec §11 `issue_ref`-adoption write), `--plan-path` whenever a plan exists, and save **on the work
branch** — these are the identity keys a standalone `/code-review` matches on (`issue_ref` / `plan_path` /
`branch`) to find and append to this exact thread:

```bash
python3 plugins/saga/scripts/saga.py save \
  --kind <issue|task> \
  --id <issue-number-or-task-slug> \
  --issue-ref <owner/repo#N> \
  --lifecycle-phase work \
  --phase-status in_progress \
  --plan-path docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-plan.md \
  --destination <plan-only|pr|merge|nonprod-deploy> \
  --orchestration-mode <inline|cc-workflows-ultracode> \
  --orchestration-recommended <recommend_execution_backend() output> \
  --rounds-seen "1"
```

**No front-loaded ceremony start.** Issue #345's `start` transition pushed the working branch and
opened a draft pull request right after this mint, so that reaching "ship" later flipped the draft
ready rather than opening a fresh one. It went with the ship ceremony in issue #1027, and nothing
replaces it: the build loop opens no pull request, because there is nothing to review until the
criterion is green. The pull request is opened once, at Phase 5.4, under explicit confirmation.

`--id` is the only strictly required flag (`--kind` defaults to `issue`); for ad-hoc `task` work pass
`--kind task --id <slug>` and omit `--issue-ref` (then `--plan-path` + the on-branch save are the match
keys). `save` mints unconditionally (correct here — `/work` is the minter), and when Phase 0.3 matched it
appends a tick to the existing directory rather than forking. Never `git add` the tick (saga state is
git-ignored, machine-local). Never set `next_round` — it is derived from `rounds_seen` (saga-spec §6.1).

### 1.5 A Claude Code Workflow run, after an explicit invocation

Enter this step only when `orchestration_mode == cc-workflows-ultracode` — which happens only when
the plan's `backend:` field recorded an explicit invocation, or the operator names it in this
session. Never enter it because the recommender suggested it, and never as a silent substitute for
`inline`. `/work` does not hand-roll sequential subagents as a substitute
either: it runs the real Workflow tool or halts visibly.

The whole of this step — the freshness re-emission, the invocation identity, the reservation
contract, the halt conditions, the launch, the post-run settlement, and the retry derivation — is
in [`references/workflow-backend.md`](../../references/workflow-backend.md). For every other
backend, continue to Phase 2.

---

## Phase 2 — Execute phase by phase

**When `orchestration_mode == cc-workflows-ultracode`:** Phase 1.5 already launched the Workflow tool.
The Workflow runtime owns execution; `/work` does not re-enter Phase 2 execution steps for those units.
Resume here only for post-workflow wrap-up (Phase 3 gate, Phase 4 record, Phase 5 PR-ready) once the
Workflow run returns.

Execute **one meaningful phase at a time** per `references/execution-strategy.md` (for the
`inline` mode, and for post-workflow Phase 2 wrap-up):

No admission pinning: the inline admission snapshot — pinned before the first direct spawn and
cleared once every direct child is authoritatively terminal — retired with the lease lifecycle
hook (#677/U5). Direct `Agent`/`Task` spawns carry no lease admission.

- **Execution strategy** — inline / serial subagents / parallel subagents, chosen from task count and
  dependency structure, gated by the **Parallel Safety Check** (file-to-unit overlap → worktree
  isolation, or downgrade to serial when isolation is unavailable). Subagent dispatch passes each unit's
  Goal / Files / Approach / Execution note / Patterns / Test scenarios / Verification and **preserves the
  U-ID**.
- **Build-unit tier** — When directly launching a build unit, resolve its `{model, effort}` by
  running the resolver, not by reading it:

  ```bash
  # explicit plan tier
  python3 plugins/saga/scripts/lifecycle_state.py resolve-build-unit-tier \
    --plan-model <model> --plan-effort <effort>
  # or, with no explicit tier, from the work shape (default: mechanical)
  python3 plugins/saga/scripts/lifecycle_state.py resolve-build-unit-tier --work-shape <shape>
  ```

  It prints `{"model": ..., "effort": ...}` as JSON. An explicit plan tier wins on **precedence**,
  and is still validated against the same vocabulary the shape path resolves from — a model or
  effort the registry does not carry is refused rather than passed through to a spawn. Otherwise the
  work shape (default `mechanical` when undeclared per `references/execution-strategy.md`) resolves
  through the shared `work_shapes` registry in `staffing.json` via `tier_resolver` /
  `tier_defaults`. **The
  resolver takes no host or session input at all**, so the dispatch never consults the host
  session's tier — it cannot read one it is never given. Record the resolved tier in the Phase-4
  work-session execution evidence.
- **Follow existing patterns** — read the plan's referenced code first; match naming and conventions;
  grep for similar implementations before inventing.
- **Already shipped → verify, don't reimplement.** If a unit's `Verification` is already satisfied by the
  current code (shipped on a prior round/session), confirm it matches, mark it complete, and move on —
  do not silently reimplement.
- **Incremental commits** per logical unit (clean conventional messages, no attribution footers; the
  heuristic and commit-ownership-by-isolation-mode are in `references/execution-strategy.md`).
- **Simplify at phase boundaries** — review recently changed files for consolidation after a cluster of
  units, not after every single one.
- **Poll the mid-run adjustment envelope at each phase/segment boundary (#372).** Before starting the
  next phase, read `.saga/adjustment-envelope.json` via `adjustment_envelope.poll(...)` (schema in
  loop. The poll decision governs the boundary:
  - `drain` (operator `quiesce`) or `halt` (`andon_halt`/`cancel`/`abort`) — finish the in-flight unit,
    dispatch no new phase, and surface the resume point; do not start the next phase.
  - `pause` — a plan-declared `pause_after: <this-segment>` halts **exactly** at this boundary and
    resumes only on the explicit continue signal (`adjustment_envelope.acknowledge_pause(...)`); a
    matching `resume_tier`/`resume_context` amendment is applied to the next phase and recorded in the
    work-session writeup so the honored change is visible (verified, not silently dropped).
  - A malformed/unknown directive **fails closed** — the run halts and names the offending directive
    rather than proceeding.
  - Absent any `pause_after`, only irreversible actions pause; reversible board/label/issue/branch/PR
    mutations proceed and are reported to the operator after the fact. They are **not** recoverable
    by a saga command — the undo ledger and `/undo` were removed in #666 (never wired to any
    producer, never wrote a record), and `/ship --undo` went with the ship ceremony in #1027.
    There is no rollback command; a merge is undone with ordinary git.

---

## Phase 3 — The build loop: run the written exit criterion until it is green

The criterion was written before the work started. Read it, run it, and repeat — that is the whole
of this phase. Its contract, the check map with every divergence this repository has, the three
statuses and the exit codes are in `plugins/saga/references/mechanical-baseline.md`.

**Read it first, before implementing.** A worker that has seen the finish line writes toward it:

```bash
uv run python plugins/saga/scripts/build_loop.py --issue <N> --dry-run
```

That prints the mechanical baseline with the lens-catalogue check each command answers, any
catalogue check this repository's baseline does not cover and why, any named scanner it has not
configured, the plan's functional checks, the plan's scenario smoke, and whether a branch preview
is declared. It runs nothing and writes nothing.

**Then run it, once per iteration:**

```bash
uv run python plugins/saga/scripts/build_loop.py --issue <N> --unit <unit-id>
```

One invocation is one iteration. It runs every part of the criterion, appends the results to the
unit's `build_loop` block in the run record, and prints what passed and what did not.

**Read the exit code, and nothing else:**

- **0 — green.** Every check passed and the preview is either green or undeclared. The block now
  carries `handed_to_code_review` with the full forty-character revision. Go to Phase 5.
- **4 — not green yet.** At least one entry is `fail` or `could-not-execute`. **This is a loop
  iteration, not a refusal and not a gate.** Fix what the results name, commit, and run it again.
  Do not ask the operator, do not record an override, and do not proceed to code review: there is
  nothing here to override, because nothing here is refusing.
- **2 or 3 — a refusal.** The record could not be read, the unit was not named, or its version is
  not one this saga writes. Say which and stop; these are the only stops in the loop.

**Fetch the base before the first iteration** so the criterion runs against the merged state and
reflects what actually lands, not stale local state.

**What a failing entry means, by status.** `fail` is a defect in the work: the check ran and said
no. `could-not-execute` is an environment problem — a missing program, a timeout, a command that
does not parse — and is never reported as a pass and never as a defect, which is the lens
catalogue's own rule. Fix the environment for the second; fix the code for the first.

**The repository's own pre-push gate stays.** It is the repository's rule, not saga's, and the loop
neither replaces nor suppresses it.

---

## Phase 4 — Record (saga tick + work-session + issue progress)

After each meaningful phase:

### 4.1 Work-session writeup

Write a concise `docs/work-sessions/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>.md` for the phase: what was built (by U-ID), the
key decisions, files modified, `change_kinds` (the derived list, recorded because a later reader wants
to know what kind of change this was), the build loop's result, and the single next step.

**Record the exit criterion the loop ran and the criterion the record holds as the same thing, not as
two derivations.** The writeup names the iteration number, its revision, and each check's status
verbatim from the unit's `build_loop` block — it never re-derives a criterion of its own, and it
never summarises a `could-not-execute` as a pass or a fail. The block is the authority and the
writeup is a rendering of it; two derivations of one criterion is exactly the drift the written
criterion was introduced to remove.

This is the canonical, durable home (`handoff_envelope.py` classifies it resume-ready) — no new
directory.

### 4.2 Save a saga tick

Append a per-phase tick carrying `lifecycle_phase=work` forward, the phase number and status, the checks
run, the work-session path, and the files modified:

```bash
python3 plugins/saga/scripts/saga.py save \
  --kind <issue|task> --id <...> \
  --lifecycle-phase work --phase <N> --phase-status <in_progress|complete> \
  --checks-run "pytest|ruff|mypy" \
  --work-session-paths "docs/work-sessions/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>.md" \
  --files-modified "path/a.py|path/b.py" \
  --rounds-seen "1" \
  --gate-verdict "tests:<done|failed|in-progress|not-reached>:<short-ref>" \
  --next-step "<the one imperative resume anchor>"
```

The `--gate-verdict` state MUST be one of the six canonical gate states (`done` / `in-progress` /
`blocked` / `failed` / `halted` / `not-reached`) — the same wire vocabulary `status_card.py` renders.
`plugins/saga/scripts/saga.py save` validates every `--gate-verdict` value through `parse_gate_verdict`
at save time and refuses the whole save with `error: <message>` at exit 2 when the parser rejects it,
writing neither the tick envelope nor the `state.json` entry; the parser's message naming the six
canonical states is surfaced verbatim. A passing test gate is `tests:done:<ref>`, a failure is
`tests:failed:<ref>`, still-running is `tests:in-progress:<ref>`.

List fields are full-snapshot (saga-spec §6) — pass the complete current set each tick, not a delta.

Layer-2 artifact pointers were stored by a script in the team-execution plugin, which issue #1030
archived. The tick's `--artifact-pointers` flag still accepts a typed pointer -- the field is durable
and a historical tick still reads back -- but nothing in the chain writes one now; large evidence
goes in the run record's per-unit envelopes instead.

### 4.3 Issue progress (mission-control)

When an issue exists, render the progress comment with the **extended `issue_progress.py` CLI** and post
it through `mission-control` (which owns issue comments and board moves). The CLI now forwards the function's
full field set:

```bash
python3 plugins/saga/scripts/issue_progress.py \
  --event phase --issue-ref owner/repo#N --destination pr \
  --plan-path docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-plan.md \
  --work-session-path docs/work-sessions/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>.md \
  --commit-sha <sha> \
  --checks-run "pytest|ruff|mypy" \
  --blockers "<none or text>" \
  --doc-review-artifact docs/reviews/<artifact>.md \
  --doc-review-fixes "<safe fix 1>|<safe fix 2>" \
  --doc-review-findings "<finding 1>|<finding 2>" \
  --doc-review-override "<rationale if doc-review gate waived>" \
  --review-gate-override "<rationale if review gate waived>"
```

`--doc-review-fixes` carries the safe fixes the plan review applied into the issue comment, under
the heading `doc review fixes`. Pass it whenever the review edited the plan: without it the comment
records the findings and silently drops what was done about them, which reads on the issue as a
review that found problems and fixed nothing.

An override must name which gate it waives: `--doc-review-override` for the doc-review gate and
`--review-gate-override` for the review gate. What makes that unambiguous is the **split itself** —
two flags, each hard-wired to one gate, so a rationale cannot arrive without a gate through this
path at all, and the rendered issue comment labels the two waivers `doc review override` and
`review gate override`. `issue_progress.py:_override_line` does carry a refusal for an unknown gate
name, but the source itself records that it is unreachable from here: it is a guard for a direct
caller, and describing it as what enforces the property reads as a runtime check that never runs.

Then **post it**, through the same reconcile controller Phase 4.4 uses. Rendering is not posting, and
"hand it to `mission-control`" was for a long time the only instruction here — so nothing ran, and no
lifecycle ever updated its issue. The whole path already existed: the op is in the certificate
allowlist as `issue-progress-comment` (tier `additive`, `always_operator=False`, so no prompt),
`board_progression` stamps an idempotency marker into the body, and `mission-control`'s
`issue comment` verb performs the write.

```bash
python3 plugins/saga/scripts/reconcile_controller.py reconcile \
  --op issue-progress-comment --repo <owner/repo> --number <N> \
  --payload "$(python3 -c 'import json,sys; print(json.dumps({"body": sys.stdin.read()}))' < <rendered-comment>)"
```

Route it through the controller rather than calling `mission-control issue comment` directly. The
verb is a plain POST — its own docstring says the *caller* owns idempotency — and a unit that is
retried or resumed would otherwise post the same phase comment twice. The controller's ledger
collapses a repeat tick to `{"status":"skipped"}`, and orchestrate retries units by design.

Read the record JSON by the contract in "Reading a lifecycle record" under Phase 4.4. This op is a
comment rather than a lifecycle field, so it carries no `field` identity and no pair to check:
`written`/`skipped` is success for it, and `halt`/`gated` means fall back to the operator-prompted
path rather than forcing the write.

Record durable learnings/decisions in the engineering journal as they surface. `/work` renders the
comment and drives it through the controller; it does not mutate the issue by any other route.

### 4.4 Post-merge board actions — one move, at the boundary it belongs to

After a merge, the card moves once, and the move is named by a **lifecycle boundary** rather than by
a status a caller picked:

```bash
uv run python plugins/saga/scripts/board_progression.py \
  --record <run record path> --boundary merge-and-deploy --dry-run
```

The dry run prints the single move and writes nothing; without `--dry-run` the same command submits
it. The boundary-to-pair table is the lifecycle repository's own
`lifecycle_field_mutation.allowed_submissions`, which it calls the single authority on what a caller
may submit, and a pair outside that list is refused before any board is touched.

**Deciding and submitting is not writing.** Mission Control remains the only executor of a `Stage` or
`Status` write. The submission goes through the reconcile controller, which owns the certificate
gate, the idempotency ledger and the replay key, and from there into `flow set-field`.

**When the card may move to Verify.** Only after the change is **merged** **and** the applicable
non-production deployment has succeeded, in that order. Code review, green checks and merge
readiness never move the card to Verify, and this skill submits no Verify move before merge. For
work with **no deployable software**, the merge precondition still holds and only the deployment
requirement relaxes: Verify is entered after the merge and after the delivered artifact exists in
its real consumption context, with the deployment's non-applicability recorded **with a reason** and
nothing fabricated to satisfy the transition.

**Read the record by more than its status word.** `field` must read `Stage+Status`: a bare `Status`
is a half-write, and `Awaiting verification` is a legal `Status` on its own, so a half-write looks
like success while `Stage` stays put. `skipped` is not a synonym for success either — it also means
"already keyed". A `failed` record names which half landed; a refused move is reported with the
board's reason and never retried silently.

**The two non-field operations are unchanged.** They write no project field, so the boundary
contract does not govern them and they keep the controller's own path:

```bash
python3 plugins/saga/scripts/reconcile_controller.py reconcile \
  --op issue-progress-comment --repo <owner/repo> --number <N> \
  --payload '{"body": "<the progress comment>"}'

python3 plugins/saga/scripts/reconcile_controller.py reconcile \
  --op sub-issue-close --repo <owner/repo> --number <N>
```

`sub-issue-close` closes a child whose parent is closing; it is an issue-state write, not a field
write, and the certificate keeps `PARENT_ISSUE_CLOSE` with the operator regardless.

**When the card may move to Verify (W8, SDLC R69/R71).** The move to the `Verify` stage, like every
lifecycle-field move, is executed by Mission Control — and it happens only after the change is
**merged** **and** a non-production deployment has **succeeded**, in that order, ahead of the
delivered-terminal move. PR-ready, green checks, code review, and merge readiness never move the
card to Verify, and `/work` submits no Verify move of its own at any point before merge. For work
with **no deployable software**, the same merge precondition holds — the R71 no-deployable route
relaxes the **deployment** requirement, never the **merge** requirement — so Verify is entered only
after the change is merged **and** the delivered artifact exists in its real form and consumption
context — the rendered published page for documentation, the installed version for a plugin — with
the deployment non-applicability recorded **with a reason** and no environment or
deployment record fabricated to satisfy the transition. The single authority for this condition is
the `verify_entry` block of `config/sdlc-schema.json` in `infiquetra-sdlc`, resolved by
`tools/docs/verify_entry.py`; this skill names when the move is permitted and submits it only then.

**level-triggered drift check**: every tick it re-reads the live board, so a rapid double tick
collapses to one write and an outside edit made while `/work` was at rest is re-detected. The CLI
prints a record JSON:

- `{"status":"written"}` — the move fired with **no operator prompt**. For a lifecycle pair, read
  `field` before believing it: see "Reading a lifecycle record" below.
- `{"status":"skipped"}` — **not a synonym for `written`.** It means only that this exact
  submission's replay key was already on disk, or that the live board already reads the way the
  lifecycle asserted. It is also what the controller returns when it *cannot judge* — a submission
  with no readable half, or a live board it could not read — and in both of those it carries a
  `note` saying so. A `skipped` whose `note` names an unreadable field or an unreadable board is a
  move nobody verified.
- `{"status":"error", "may_reapply":true}` — the rarest and the most dangerous to misread: **the
  board write committed and the replay key did not get recorded.** The move happened; the ledger
  does not know it. A later tick therefore re-applies it, which is harmless on a field write
  (setting an option to the value it already holds is a no-op) and is why this surfaces rather than
  raising. Do not treat it as a failure to retry by hand, and do not treat it as clean: say so in
  the phase note, because the ledger and the board disagree until the next tick reconciles them.
- `{"status":"failed"}` — no ledger key was written, so the next tick retries. For a lifecycle
  pair the message names which assignments landed and which did not; when Mission Control died
  before printing its report it says so instead of claiming nothing landed, and **both fields need
  checking by hand**.
- `{"status":"halt", ...}` with a named `halt_reason` — the outside board changed away from what
  the lifecycle asserted while `/work` was at rest. Since W7 the controller holds **no autonomous
  write authority over `Stage` or `Status`**: every outside drift — including a reversible
  Status-field edit — is surfaced with its named reason, never silently overwritten or
  auto-corrected. Surface the `halt_reason` to the operator and fall back to the operator-prompted
  `mission-control` path.
- `{"status":"gated"}` — the reversibility certificate declining the op before anything is
  attempted: an unauthorized merge or deploy, an unauthorized correction field, or a malformed
  submission. Fall back to the operator-prompted `mission-control` path unchanged.

`gated` and `halt` are the two withholding outcomes and they are **not the same decision**. `gated`
is the certificate refusing the op; `halt` is the drift check finding the live board somewhere else
and declining to overwrite it. Both are the controller correctly withholding an action that needs a
human, never a failure — and **neither is cleared by re-running the same call**, which is why a
caller must not offer a retry for either.

`halt` is **not** an allowlist verdict, and the empty allowlist is easy to misread as one:
`AUTO_CORRECT_OP_KINDS` is `frozenset()` and no conditional anywhere reads it, so nothing is
classified by membership in it. What the empty allowlist records is that the auto-correct branch was
**deleted**, leaving `halt` as the only outcome a drift can have — the controller holds no
autonomous lifecycle-field write authority at all (W7).

**Reading a lifecycle record — what proves a pair moved, and what does not.**

A `(Stage, Status)` submission is one invocation carrying two assignments, and the record's `field`
is the whole submission's identity: `Stage+Status` when both halves were executed, and a bare
`Status` when they were not. That single field is the only proof available that the saga which
*executed* the call was new enough to carry the pair at all — an older installed saga ignores the
second assignment, writes `Status` alone, and still reports `written`. **A record whose `field` is
not `Stage+Status` did not move the Stage half, whatever its `status` says.**

Mission Control exposes **no read-back for the `Stage` field**: `board view` groups cards by
`Status` only, and the reconcile controller's own drift check reads `Status` for the same reason.
So "check both halves" is not a board read — it is these three, in order:

1. the record's `field` names both halves;
2. its `status` is `written`, or a `skipped` carrying **both** a `key` and no `note` — the `key` is
   what distinguishes "this exact submission is already on disk" from a record that simply lacks a
   note because the saga that wrote it is too old to emit one, and a note-free keyless `skipped` is
   not evidence of anything;
3. on a `failed`, the message's *landed / NOT landed* detail names which assignment to repair.

When all three cannot be satisfied — an `error`, or a `failed` with no report — say so and open the
card in a browser rather than asserting the move. Do not report a lifecycle move as complete on the
strength of a `status` word alone.

**The controller's exit code is coarser than its record; read the record.** `reconcile_controller.py
reconcile` exits **0** for `written`, `skipped`, `corrected`, `gated` and `halt` — convergence and
both withholding outcomes share one code, deliberately, because a gate is expected rather than a
crash. It exits **1** for `failed` and for `error`, so those two are indistinguishable by exit code
even though they are opposites: `failed` wrote nothing and the next tick retries, while `error`
means the board write **did** commit and only the replay key is missing. `detect` exits 0 for every
observation. An unknown subcommand exits **2**. A caller that branches on the exit code alone will
treat a committed write as a failure and retry a move that already landed.

`/work` still does **not** merge or deploy autonomously (permanently gated), and the controller
never widens the autonomously-writable set beyond what `board_progression`/`reversibility_certificate`
already establish (#450 non-goal).

## Phase 5 — Code-review gate, PR-ready, continuation routing

### 5.1 Run /code-review programmatically and capture the reviewed SHA

Call `/code-review` in `programmatic` / `report-only` mode. In that mode `/code-review` returns its
structured findings envelope to the caller and writes nothing durable — **the caller owns persistence**
(its own contract).

**The reviewed revision is the one the loop went green at, read from the record — not a fresh
`git rev-parse`.** The build loop wrote it into the unit's `build_loop.handed_to_code_review` on the
green iteration, and that is the whole point of recording it: the revision the review covers must be
the revision the criterion passed at, and re-reading `HEAD` here would silently hand over a later
commit that nothing has checked.

```bash
REVIEWED_SHA=$(uv run python plugins/saga/scripts/run_record.py show <N> \
  | python3 -c 'import json,sys; r=json.load(sys.stdin); print(r["units"][0]["build_loop"]["handed_to_code_review"]["revision"])')
```

It is a full forty-character commit identifier, which is the only shape `/code-review` accepts. If
the block carries no `handed_to_code_review`, the loop never went green: go back to Phase 3 rather
than reviewing unchecked work.

The findable saga `/work` minted in Phase 1.4 (`issue_ref` / `plan_path` / branch) is what a *standalone*
`/code-review` would later append `review_paths` to. For this in-loop gate, `/work` reads the envelope
**directly** — no saga round-trip, no dependency on `/code-review` writing an artifact (it doesn't, in
programmatic mode).

### 5.2 Read the gate input (the envelope)

Read `/code-review`'s serialized `review_result.v1`; any accompanying human rendering may group
findings by `autofix_class`, but it adds no decision field. The result's `outcome` is the sole decision
field and is the gate input. Record that outcome, the finding inventory as metadata, and `REVIEWED_SHA`
in the Phase-4 work-session writeup; if you want a durable artifact, persist the result through the
evidence ledger (#398) —
`evidence_ledger.py write --check-id code-review --reviewed-sha "$REVIEWED_SHA" --producer work-gate
--verdict <the typed result's outcome> --artifact-file <result-json-file>` — rather than a bare file
write, so this programmatic-mode persistence gets the same no-clobber/custody guarantee as
`/code-review`'s own interactive-mode write (SKILL.md §5.3). `--verdict` is the evidence-ledger field
name; it does not create a second decision field beside `outcome`.

### 5.3 Outcome-driven review gate (typed outcome or stale)

Route the complete typed outcome set as follows:

- **`accepted`** — proceed to PR-ready even when the result still carries findings, including Priority 2
  findings.
- **`repairs_requested`** — block PR-ready and route the consolidated fix requests through Work.
- **`cycle_cap_best_available`** — proceed with the cycle-three best-available revision and surface
  every residual.
- **`review_incomplete`** — block PR-ready and say that the review did not run: delivery did not
  establish a review, so do not invent acceptance.

These four values are the complete outcome set. Work does not recompute scores, inspect thresholds, or
derive acceptance from findings. Finding Priority and confidence are reporting and routing metadata;
neither can change the typed outcome. `/code-review` never changes reviewed code. Work is the only
mutator and applies any authorized repairs before resubmitting.

Independently, a **stale** review blocks PR-ready because the code moved since `REVIEWED_SHA`. This is a
freshness decision, not an acceptance decision. Compute it directly against the SHA `/work` captured at
review time (see `references/test-and-gates.md` for the staleness mechanism only; do not read an
acceptance rule from that reference):

  ```bash
  git rev-list <REVIEWED_SHA>..HEAD --count
  ```

A count `> 0` means commits landed since the review: keep PR-ready blocked and re-run `/code-review`,
capturing a fresh `REVIEWED_SHA`, before any PR/merge offer.

Allow an explicit operator override only with a **recorded** rationale (it flows into the issue comment
via `--review-gate-override` for the review gate and `--doc-review-override` for the doc-review gate,
each rendered through `issue_progress.py:_override_line` under its own gate's label, plus the
work-session). Never a silent skip.

### 5.4 The merge turn, the release, the functional test, and the close

Review acceptance is not a board move. The lifecycle repository's allowed-submission list carries no
row for it, so saga submits nothing at that boundary and records it in the run record only:

```bash
uv run python plugins/saga/scripts/board_progression.py \
  --record <run record path> --boundary review-accepted --dry-run
```

That prints the honest absence rather than a move. What follows it are four steps.

1. **Render the operator status header** via the shared card renderer
   (`plugins/saga/scripts/status_card.py`, `project_work`) — the single emitter of operator-facing
   status for `/work`. Pass the restored saga object; the card derives its cells on-read from
   durable state (`gate_verdicts`, `review_paths`, `pr_refs`, `phase_status`, `destination`) and
   renders as a fixed-position glyph card with an indexed footer pointing at the evidence. The
   work-session notes, the review findings and the test output stay as drill-down detail below the
   card; they are what the cells reference, not what the card replaces.

2. **Take the merge turn.** Exactly one worker merges at a time, and the turn is a field on the run
   record's `units` rows, not a lock. A row left at `merging` by a turn that died is released after
   being checked against git, never trusted:

   ```bash
   uv run python plugins/saga/scripts/merge_turn.py \
     --record <run record path> --repo-root <repo> --parent-branch <parent branch> \
     merge --unit <unit name>
   ```

   The turn merges onto the parent issue branch or the default branch according to
   `admission.destination`, in a detached worktree created and removed inside the turn. It refuses,
   by name, a merge that would take any file backwards relative to a freshly fetched default branch
   — and it refuses when that fetch fails, because a guard read against a stale remote-tracking
   reference passes silently. After a merge it re-integrates twice and reports both: the advanced
   destination branch into every surviving unit branch, and the fetched default branch into the
   parent branch. A branch that needs a real merge is reported `pending` for the worker who owns it,
   never forced.

   An ordinary conflict is the merging worker's own work. A conflict that is not mechanical is
   routed by kind and decided by nobody at the merge: a behaviour question that is technical under
   the recorded intent goes to the Architect, a product question the recorded intent already answers
   goes to Product, and a conflict that needs the plan changed returns to planning as that problem.

3. **Release, then submit the one move the boundary allows.** The Release Worker merges the parent
   pull request through the repository's configured merge method, bound to the exact head the
   required checks ran against:

   ```bash
   uv run python plugins/saga/scripts/release_step.py --record <run record path> \
     release --pull-request <N> --merge-method <merge|squash|rebase>
   ```

   It waits by reading GitHub's own verdict, never a watch command's exit status, and it records the
   reviewed head and the landed commit separately because a squash or a rebase produces a different
   commit. Then the destination:

   ```bash
   uv run python plugins/saga/scripts/release_step.py --record <run record path> deploy
   ```

   Where the repository profile declares `nonproduction_destination: none` — as this repository does
   — that records the absence with its reason and deploys nothing. **That is a result, not an
   error**, and no environment or deployment record is ever fabricated to fill a closeout. Where a
   destination is declared, the deploy plugin's existing handoff carries the baton and the
   acknowledgement comes back before ownership is released. No production deployment exists on this
   path at all. Then the move, once, checking both halves:

   ```bash
   uv run python plugins/saga/scripts/board_progression.py \
     --record <run record path> --boundary merge-and-deploy
   ```

   A record whose `field` reads a bare `Status` is a half-write and is reported as a failure: the
   `Status` half alone looks like success while `Stage` stays where it was. A refused move is
   reported with the board's reason and **never retried silently**.

4. **Run the functional test, then close.** The scenarios the plan prescribed run through `/qa`
   against the real environment, reading the run record rather than any ledger.
   **Run `/qa` in this turn** (issue #1029) — the acceptance evidence is the next step, and an
   operator who has to
   remember to ask for it is the transport for a step that already knows it should happen. Say in
   one line that you are running it. `/qa` still owns the advance of `lifecycle_phase` and still
   makes it only on a PASS: starting a step and deciding its verdict are different authorities, and
   only the first moved. A failure re-enters the build loop and counts against the post-merge
   allowance, which keeps its own counter of three standard and two escalated cycles plus exactly
   one recorded extension that no role may grant twice. An unrun scenario is never folded into a
   pass.

   The closeout comment is then composed from the record, and refuses to state an environment, a
   deployment or an acceptance result the record does not carry:

   ```bash
   uv run python plugins/saga/scripts/release_step.py --record <run record path> \
     close --disposition <delivered|duplicate|superseded|declined|canceled>
   ```

   It is posted before the close, carries every link the lifecycle repository requires, and records
   each inapplicable practice with a reason. The journal entries ship in the commit that ships the
   change — not afterwards, and not in a separate pass. Then the close move:

   ```bash
   uv run python plugins/saga/scripts/board_progression.py --record <run record path> --boundary close
   ```

   That resolves to `Verify` / `Ready to close` when no retro trigger fired and `Retro` /
   `Ready to close` when one did, from the record's own retro state.

**When the card opens its own pull request, the pull request is opened and the review requested as
ordinary `gh` operations.** The ship ceremony that used to carry them was removed in issue #1027:
there is no ceremony, no transition table, no reversibility tier and no receipt. **Each of them, and
the merge, stays explicitly confirmed** — that is the preservation contract issue #1029 declared, and
removing the ceremony removed the mechanism, never the confirmation. They are
**offered and confirmed, never auto-fired**. If the operator declines, hand them the prepared
pull-request body (it links the plan, the work-sessions and the code-review artifact) and the
branch. Then record `pr_refs` on the saga, set `next_step="await review on PR #N"`, and comment the
pull request's status to the issue via the extended `issue_progress.py` CLI (`--pr-url`,
`--review-status`).

The merge turn in step 2 is parent-branch integration — how a lane's work reaches a shared branch —
and it is this step's, which is where issue #1027's hand-over to "the integrate step" points.

When the run stops before the merge — a refused turn, an unapproved or stale pull request, a release
still waiting on a check — report where it stopped and what would move it, and leave the run
record's `next_step` naming that. Do not run `/qa` on an unmerged thread.

At thread completion set `status=done`.

### 5.5 Hard boundary

`/work` builds, runs the written criterion until it is green, records, takes the merge turn,
releases, runs the functional test, and closes.

It does **NOT** silently mutate GitHub:
PR-open, review-request, and merge are each explicitly confirmed, and merge is a git op `/work`
owns only under confirmation — issue #1029's preservation contract, which outlived the ceremony
that used to carry it. It does **NOT** refuse: the build loop's only non-green outcome is another
iteration, and the only stops in it are an unreadable record or an unnamed unit. It does **NOT**
judge whether the tests are adequate — the criterion was written at admission, and re-deciding it
here would be the judgment the criterion replaced.

It does **NOT** compose or execute a board write: every move above stops at mission-control's
constrained lifecycle-field mutation, and this skill names the boundary and nothing else. It submits
**no status the lifecycle repository's allowed list does not carry**, so `Ready to merge` and
`Closeout` are never submitted even where a board offers them. It does **NOT** deploy to production,
and no argument on this path produces a production deployment. It does **NOT** own deploy or canary
(`deploy` owns deployment mutation and production-health revert). It does **NOT** file SDLC issues
(`mission-control` owns issue creation).

It does **NOT** advance `lifecycle_phase` past `work` — the advance to `qa` is **`/qa`'s to make,
and only on a PASS**; on a FAIL `/qa` keeps the phase at `work` and records the evidence. So the
saga legitimately sits at `work` from merge until `/qa` runs and passes. `/work` **runs** `/qa`
after a merge (§5.4) and still does not make the advance that `/qa` alone can make — starting a step
and deciding its verdict are different authorities, and only the first moved (issue #1029). (This is
not a deferral awaiting a rebuild: the `/qa` skill exists at `plugins/saga/skills/qa/`.)

Build, run the criterion, record, merge, release, test again, close — then stop.
