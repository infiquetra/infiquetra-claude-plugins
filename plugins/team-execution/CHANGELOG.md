## [1.5.0] — 2026-03-29

### Fixed
- **Workers now pack into 2x2 grids, reviewers get solo windows**: `agent-overflow.sh` completely rewritten with two-phase routing. Phase 1 (synchronous): break new pane from orchestrator window immediately. Phase 2 (background, 1s delay): read pane title and route — `worker-*` agents join into an existing `workers` window (up to 4 panes tiled), reviewers/advocates stay solo with their agent name as the window name.
- **Shift+Down no longer intercepted by tmux**: Removed `-n` (no-prefix) flag from `S-Up`/`S-Down` bindings. Now require prefix key so terminal apps (vim, less, text selection) receive Shift+arrows normally. New binding: `prefix + Shift+Down/Up`.
- **Window creation beeps silenced**: Added `bell-action none` and `visual-bell off` to tmux.conf.
- **Windows named after agents**: After pane title propagates (~1s), the new window is renamed to the agent name (e.g., `security-reviewer`, `devils-advocate`) or `workers` for worker windows.
- **Window management with many agents**: Added `prefix+w` (fullscreen window tree) and `prefix+f` (find window by name). Window name truncated to 15 chars in status bar to prevent overflow with 10+ windows.

### Changed
- `agent-overflow.sh`: Full rewrite — uses `break-pane -d -P -F '#{window_id}'` to capture stable window ID at break time, routing via background subprocess
- `tmux.conf`: Bell suppression, Shift fix, window name format, two new keybindings
- Quick reference comments updated to describe new window layout model

## [1.4.0] — 2026-03-29

### Fixed
- **Workers no longer prompt user for permissions**: Changed worker spawn mode from `plan` to `bypassPermissions`. Claude Code's `plan` mode routes file access prompts and plan approval requests to the user — not the orchestrator. `bypassPermissions` workers run unrestricted with no user interruptions; quality control is handled entirely by the review cycle.
- **tmux agent overflow**: `agent-overflow.sh` MAX_PANES was static at 4, allowing all 4 workers to crowd into the main window before overflow triggered. Changed to dynamic logic: main window (index 1) gets MAX_PANES=1 (agents always overflow to their own window); agent overflow windows get MAX_PANES=4.

### Changed
- Step A4 team structure template: worker rows now show `bypassPermissions` mode instead of `plan (requires approval)`
- Review Protocol note updated: "Workers run in `bypassPermissions` mode — no permission prompts, quality enforced by review cycle"
- Step B1 rewritten from "Plan Approval Gate" to "Worker Kickoff" — workers read their tasks and begin implementing immediately; no ExitPlanMode/plan_approval_request flow for workers
- `docs/agent-overflow.sh` (plugin copy) kept in sync with installed `~/.config/tmux/agent-overflow.sh`

## [1.3.0] — 2026-03-29

### Changed
- Skill now auto-suggests during plan mode for any non-trivial plan (3+ steps, 3+ files)
- Expanded natural language triggers: "use agents", "agent team", "agentic team", "team of agents", "agentic approach", "run with agents", etc.
- When auto-suggesting, offers A/B choice so user can always decline
- Skill no longer re-suggests if user declines in the same session

## [1.2.0] — 2026-03-29

### Added
- **Step A0: Environment Pre-flight** in SKILL.md — checks CLAUDE.md handoff rule, tmux environment, and Claude settings before Phase A begins
- **`/team-setup` command** — standalone setup wizard that validates environment, offers to install tmux config + overflow script, configures Claude settings, and manages CLAUDE.md handoff rule
- tmux checks are opt-out: users can dismiss permanently, re-enable with `/team-setup reset`
- Checks Claude `settings.json` for `teammateMode` and `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS`

## [1.1.0] — 2026-03-29

### Changed
- Phase A now calls `ExitPlanMode` itself (new Step A5) — plan is a single atomic artifact
- Added Critical Constraints block at Phase B entry: TeamCreate is the ONLY permitted first action
- Strengthened CLAUDE.md auto-handoff rule with explicit prohibitions against Agent tool usage

## [1.0.0] — 2026-03-25

### Added
- Initial release of the `team-execution` plugin (ported from vecu-team-execution v2.0.0, made organization-agnostic)
- Two-phase execution model: Phase A during plan mode, Phase B orchestrated directly by Claude
- `team-execution` skill: Phase A team planning + Phase B orchestration protocol
- `/team-execute` slash command
- 3 base reviewers always present:
  - `devils-advocate-reviewer` (red): challenges assumptions, edge cases, failure modes
  - `security-reviewer` (orange): OWASP/secrets/auth/PII coverage
  - `architecture-reviewer` (purple): design patterns, separation of concerns, convention adherence
- 7 optional reviewers triggered by keyword detection:
  - `infra-reviewer` (blue): CDK/AWS/Lambda/DynamoDB
  - `api-reviewer` (green): API design/versioning/deprecation
  - `testing-reviewer` (yellow): test coverage/patterns
  - `code-quality-reviewer` (cyan): DRY/SOLID/complexity/naming
  - `privacy-reviewer` (pink): privacy by design/PII/GDPR
  - `clarity-reviewer` (teal): docs readability/structure/understandability
  - `ai-usefulness-reviewer` (gold): AI-consumability of specs/issues
- Reference files:
  - `reviewer-registry.md`: keyword trigger map for optional reviewers
  - `review-criteria.md`: scoring rubrics for all reviewer types
  - `consensus-protocol.md`: 3-iteration process, scoring thresholds, escalation
- Plan triage escape hatch for trivial config-only changes
- Plan type classification: code vs docs/specs vs mixed
- Claude acts as orchestrator directly — no separate execution-lead agent needed

### Changed from vecu-team-execution v2.0.0
- Removed `execution-lead` agent — Claude orchestrates directly
- Replaced `adr-reviewer` with `architecture-reviewer` (project-agnostic pattern/convention review)
- Removed all organization-specific ADR path dependencies
- Removed hardcoded ADR references (ADR-005, ADR-006, ADR-013, ADR-027)
- Updated all file paths to `team-execution/` prefix
- Updated author and repository metadata to Infiquetra
