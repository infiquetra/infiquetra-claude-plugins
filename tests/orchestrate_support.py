"""Shared scaffolding for the Orchestrate tests, against the per-issue run record (issue #1025).

Every Orchestrate test builds a throwaway git repository under pytest's ``tmp_path`` and a
throwaway record store beside it. **Nothing here ever touches the primary checkout's live record
store, a live herdr, or this repository's own worktrees**, and every module that drives the plugin
goes through these helpers so that rule is stated once rather than re-derived per file.

The one thing worth knowing: ``run_record.resolve_store_root`` asks git for the *common*
directory, so a test that let it resolve would write into the developer's own
``.claude/saga/runs``. Every helper therefore passes ``--store-root`` explicitly, which is the
override the record module documents for exactly this reason.
