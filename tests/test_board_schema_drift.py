"""Credential-free drift guard for the committed board census (#1020).

`board_census.py --check` already compares the committed census against the
LIVE GitHub Projects API -- but it deliberately prints SKIPPED and exits 0
when no `project`-scoped token is available, which is every normal CI run
(DECISIONS `{#board-census-shape-only-live-skip-424}`). That posture is
correct and is not changed here; its consequence is that a drift can sit
unnoticed for months, which is exactly what happened: the committed census
went two board migrations stale between 2026-07-14 and 2026-09-19 while the
live leg reported nothing on every run.

This module closes that gap with an invariant that needs no network and no
credentials, so it gives signal on every CI run: whatever the census records
must agree with the vocabulary `sdlc-schema.json` declares. `sdlc-schema.json`
is the source of truth for board Status vocabulary (DECISIONS
`{#board-vocabulary-schema-is-truth-584}`); the census is a snapshot of the
live boards. When the two disagree, either the snapshot is stale or a board
drifted from the contract, and both are worth failing over.

The live comparison remains available here as an opt-in leg, enabled with
`BOARD_SCHEMA_LIVE=1`, and is skipped otherwise.
