"""The saga command surface is exactly thirteen commands in fourteen files.

Issue 1030. The card's first acceptance criterion is a count, and a count alone is a weak guard: a
tree that deleted one survivor and kept one removed command still prints fourteen. So this module
checks three things that a count cannot -- which names survive, which names are gone, and that every
surviving command still resolves the skill it names.

The removed names are spelled here exactly as the card and the acceptance criterion spell them, so a
partially reverted deletion fails on the name rather than on arithmetic.
