"""The plan-review loop: /plan dispatches it, and /work still refuses without the override.

Issue 1026, units U1 through U4, and card 933. These cases pin instruction text, because what
changed is what the three skills instruct — there is no runtime module between the operator and
the behaviour. Each case therefore names the file and the contract sentence it guards, so a later
edit that drops the sentence fails here rather than silently removing a gate.
