"""The never-written `review` phase, the artifact-matching conventions, and the commit SHA.

Issue 1026 unit U7, card 934 — the maintenance sweep. Every item is a description that no longer
matched the system.

One boundary is asserted as a negative and matters more than the positives: **no write path to the
`review` phase was added.** The tempting repair for "a declared phase nothing writes" is to make
something write it, which would be a behaviour change smuggled in as documentation maintenance.
