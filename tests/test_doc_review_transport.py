"""The operator is the transport, the prohibition names no script, and the reference resolves.

Issue 1026 unit U6, card 931 — the Document Review half of closed issue 776, which Code Review
completed and Document Review did not.

The cross-reference case is the one that matters. Its predecessor asserted a *path string*, so it
passed while the reference was broken: the cited file existed and defined neither of the two
fields cited from it. A test that asserts a string is a test that will pass forever regardless of
the truth, so this one resolves the target and reads it.
