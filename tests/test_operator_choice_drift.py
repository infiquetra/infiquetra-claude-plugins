"""Drift guard: `operator-choice.md` must keep telling the truth about the backend enum.

**What this file used to guard, and why it does not any more.** Until issue 1030 it pinned
§3.2's two dynamic-workflow purposes across every offer surface, so a SKILL rebuild could not
quietly resell Claude Code Workflows as fan-out only. Issue 1030 archived the `team-execution`
plugin and removed the `cc-workflows` plugin, so there is no offer left to make and no purpose
list left to under-sell. The sweep that retired those assertions left this module behind with its
constants and its two private helpers and **no test function at all** — a file that looks like a
guard in the tree, collects zero tests, and reports green forever.

So the file keeps its name and its subject and guards the thing that actually can drift now: the
document's claim about the enum must match the engine's enum. A reference document that says
"there are three values" while `saga.py` accepts one is the failure mode this repository keeps
hitting, and it is exactly the kind of claim a reader trusts without checking.

Three assertions, and each names something a sweep could break:

* the document does not tell a reader that `team-execution` or `cc-workflows-ultracode` is
  selectable;
* the document names every value `saga.py` actually accepts;
* the sections that survive only as history say so in their own text, so a reader who lands in
  §3 or §8 from a search result is told before they read a menu that no longer exists.
