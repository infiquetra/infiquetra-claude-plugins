"""The authoring contract for the two ordering edges, ``after`` and ``serialize``.

``serialize`` was added to the runtime alongside ``after`` -- both gate launch identically, and
what differs is what they claim -- but for a whole run nothing in the supported workflow could
emit it: neither the command nor the skill mentioned it, and a planner who needed to stagger two
units off one file fell back to ``after``, asserting a dependency that did not exist. These tests
pin the producer path: both surfaces teach both edges and when to reach for each, the Phase 4 JSON
contract shows a unit actually authoring ``serialize``, and neither surface ever again calls
``after`` the only ordering.
