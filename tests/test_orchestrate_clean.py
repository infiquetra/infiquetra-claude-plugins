"""Cleanup runs for every unit, names every leftover, and retires this run's workspaces (U6).

Three defects meet here. Issue 960: ``land --clean`` skipped the reap entirely when one landing
path could not be cleaned, and said nothing about the skip. Issue 979: a removal failure recorded
while an exception was unwinding was appended to a list whose only reader that path skipped.
Issue 991: the cleanup-failure test chose one of three host mechanisms, so which failure shape ran
differed per machine and every run left an undeletable directory behind.

**Every failure in this module is injected at the command runner.** The same code path therefore
runs on every machine, a defect appearing under only one platform cannot pass, and nothing
undeletable is left on disk. That is issue 991's repair, and it is why this module replaces the
cleanup assertions that lived in ``test_orchestrate_land_clean.py`` and
``test_orchestrate_land_worktree.py``.
