"""Documentation hygiene for the Orchestrate plugin.

The run-state half of this module went with issue #1025: there is no `.orchestrate/run.json` to
keep out of the driven repository's status, so there is no `info/exclude` rule to assert, no
hand-authored task-brief directory, and no `clean --all` that deletes run state. The run-identifier
safety assertion those tests shared now lives in ``test_orchestrate_plan_check.py``, where it is
proved against a path that creates nothing at all.

What survives is the pair of checks that keep the plugin's own prose honest about what it ships.
