"""`clean --merged` once destroyed live work; these tests stand on that grave.

`landed` used to answer with two values, and "zero commits ahead of the run branch" meant landed
-- which is also exactly what a unit that has not committed yet looks like. `clean --merged` never
asked the unit's status, so it closed the tabs and removed the worktrees of two builds and two
reviews that were still working, and took about thirty-five minutes of work with them.

The corrected rule: a unit is reapable only when it is DONE and its commits are on the run
branch. `land --clean` reaps exactly that rule's units after a successful land, and nothing short
of an explicit `clean --branches` ever deletes a branch.

Same class, second verse: ``produced_anything`` measured from the run's ORIGINAL base, so a unit
created after the first land counted as productive the moment it existed -- the branch it was cut
from already carried the landed work. After a land, ``check`` could never say NO COMMITS again,
its LOOKS DONE fired on any post-land unit merely idle between turns, and ``go``'s dependency gate
could never catch an empty dependency. It now measures the unit's OWN commits: from the merge
base of the run branch and the unit's branch, plus the --no-ff merge that landed them.

Same class, third verse: a run predating the run branch landed its units straight onto the
operator's tree, and ``landed_by_merge`` refused to read that shape without a run branch -- so
a legacy unit whose work WAS merged read as produced nothing: ``check`` shouted NO COMMITS at
landed work, and ``clean --merged`` would not reap it. The second-parent shape is just as
readable on HEAD; but the fix is the shape, not a blanket yes -- a legacy branch that never
committed is still nothing to land.

Same class, fourth verse: ``land --clean`` reaped every unit the rule allowed, not only the
units its own invocation merged -- so a land that merged nothing still swept away work an
earlier invocation deliberately kept. Reaping is now a consequence of what THIS land did; the
operator's own ``clean --merged`` remains the deliberate whole-run sweep.

Same class, fifth verse: recording where a unit branch began did not prove it authored a later
tip. An empty unit could merge an advanced run branch and inherit the same ancestry as real work.
Only a no-fast-forward merge onto the run branch records enough shape to call the unit landed.

Everything here runs against a real temporary git repository. Merging and reaping are the
behaviour under test, so a fake that reports them proves nothing.
