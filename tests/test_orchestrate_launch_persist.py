"""The launch is persisted immediately, and the width number bounds it (issue #1025, U3).

Cards 900 and 990 asked for a durable claim written before launch. This card forbids one: parent
issue 1018 rules out a new lease, reservation, receipt or ledger, and says to stop and report if a
child needs one to pass its own tests. It does not. Writing the row as ``running`` *before* calling
the launcher is enough, because eligibility reads only ``pending`` units.

Card 901 asked for a real concurrency ceiling separate from ``--limit``. The ceiling is the run
record's ``concurrency_allocation``, and it counts open role panes as well as running units,
because a role session is an agent session and the number exists for the account's rate limit.
