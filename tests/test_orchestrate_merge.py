"""The merge turn, the parent branch, and the guard against reverting a newer main (U5).

``land`` is gone and ``merge`` takes its place. What went with the name is the bookkeeping around
the merge -- the retained conflict pointer that outlived an invocation, the numbered landing-path
fallback, the retained-merge recovery -- not the merge itself, which still happens in one detached
worktree created and removed inside the turn.

The merge turn is ordinary record state and not a lock: it has no owner token and no expiry, so
the refusal is derived by asking git whether a merge is actually in flight. Card 875's regression
guard survives the removal of ``collect`` as a rule of the turn.
