"""A plan is validated completely, and nothing is created (issue 879, U4).

Every plan defect used to be discovered *after* worktrees existed and a run record was written,
because the only door to the validation was ``start``. ``plan-check`` is the first half of
``start`` exposed on its own -- not a copy, so a validator cannot quietly stop agreeing with the
``start`` it claims to match.

The mutation proof is the point of this module: asserting an exit status proves nothing about
whether the path wrote something on its way to that status.
