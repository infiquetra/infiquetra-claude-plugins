"""What a unit actually changed, measured from the merge base rather than the run branch.

``run-branch..unit-branch`` is the obvious comparison and the wrong one for this question: every
unit in a phase branches from the same base, so the moment a sibling lands, that diff reports the
sibling's additions as this unit's deletions. In the run this was written for it showed a
391-line test file as deleted by a unit that had never touched it. ``diff`` measures from the
merge base -- the newest commit common to the run branch and the unit branch -- so a unit's
change is its own, whoever else has landed since.

The repository is built as the scenario this command exists for: two units off one base, one of
them landed first. The file also carries, from the same unit of work, the regressions for
``start`` rejecting an ordering edge that names a unit in no run -- the check ``expand`` already
had, lifted so both commands share it.
