"""A fresh worktree on every launch, with a declared environment step (issue #1025, U2).

Card 886 reported a relaunch reusing a stale worktree: the session found work it did not do, a
prompt could be stranded, and a second live session could end up in one tree. The answer taken
here is not to fast-forward or refuse the reused directory -- it is to never reuse one. The unit's
*branch* is its identity and is reused; only the working directory is new.

The environment step is the fifth recorded collision: a session in a worktree with no virtual
environment produces confident work that cannot run its own tests.
