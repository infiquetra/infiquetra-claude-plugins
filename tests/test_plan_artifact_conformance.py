"""Plan-artifact conformance — issue #922 (unit U1), repaired per review F06t.

The conformance check itself ships as ``plugins/saga/scripts/plan_artifact_conformance.py``
(review F06t: the shipped contract must be callable, not only enforced when pytest runs).
This file IMPORTS that module and exercises it; it does not redefine any of it. The
definition pins (marker triple, required-field set) parse the markdown declarations and
bind the shipped constants to them.

None of these tests asserts a Plan question, its wording, or the order of the conversation
(R29): the rigidity guard is asserted as the absence of rigid prose shapes in the Phase 0
intake subsection, and the corpus assertions stay relational — exit and non-empty report,
never a count or a file name (R33, obligation 7): the nested-corpus guard derives its
instances from the corpus on disk instead of naming one.

Mutation wiring (issue 924's mutation proof, now against shipped code):

* removing the required-field rule from the shipped check fails the incomplete-plan
  assertions (the fixture is reported only by that rule);
* deleting the marker half of the shipped check fails the single-pass test;
* deleting the recursion fails the nested-report test;
* re-defining any check function in this file fails the imported-not-duplicated pin.
