"""W7 (SDLC issue #88, R35): the four reconcile safety behaviours survive in the Mission Control
path, with the two the source register names as genuinely at risk tested individually.

The four behaviours (SDLC R35, plan U6):

1. **Replay safety** — a repeated reconcile tick collapses to ``skipped`` (idempotency ledger).
2. **Drift detection** — an outside edit is re-detected on the next tick (level-triggered).
3. **Closed allowlist** — a non-allowlisted op is never auto-corrected. Since W7 the allowlist is
   EMPTY (R32: no autonomous lifecycle-field write authority), the maximally closed form.
4. **Operator prompt when uncertain or consequential** — anything not mechanically safe surfaces
   as ``gated``/``halt`` for the operator instead of a write.

The two at-risk behaviours, named individually (R35):

* the **per-op level-triggered reconcile tick**, which ``/work`` and ``/loop`` have and ``/outcome``
  does not (a deliberate, tracked gap — plugins #593; asserted below as a KNOWN GAP, not hidden),
* **halt-on-irreversible-drift** surfacing a NAMED reason instead of overwriting.

Post-W7 posture (R30/R32): the controller holds no autonomous lifecycle-field write authority —
every drift halts. These tests prove the behaviours are preserved in that stricter shape, not that
the retired auto-correction survived.

Offline: real certificate/controller/board_progression modules loaded by path; writer and live
reader injected fakes; ledger on disk under tmp_path. No GitHub, no gh, no mission-control child.
