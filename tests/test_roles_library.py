"""Structural tests for the roles library (issue 1022).

Globs ``plugins/agent-launcher/roles/*.md`` and holds every prompt to the contract the
directory's own README states: four required headings in order, four non-empty frontmatter keys,
an ``emits`` list whose entries are handoff contracts the lifecycle says this very role produces,
a ``role_id`` the lifecycle names, and no vocabulary from the retired ``team-execution`` plugin.

Three properties are worth naming because each one was got wrong first.

**Every rule is a named checker function, called by both the real test and its seeded fixture.**
A seeded fixture that re-types the production regex proves a property of ``re``, not that the rule
fires. When a checker changes, both callers change with it.

**The stop-rule check is anchored to a line start.** The README has to quote the heading it
mandates, so an unanchored substring search matches the README too and a search for files
*lacking* the heading comes back empty -- passing vacuously.

**``emits`` is checked for producership, not just membership.** Membership alone would accept
``product.md`` claiming ``run-record``. The lifecycle carries ``sender_role`` per contract, so the
test asserts the emitting role is the contract's sender of record.

**The prompts are always checked against a vendored snapshot of the lifecycle**, so the same
assertions run everywhere -- on a continuous-integration runner, which has no sibling checkout, and
on a developer machine, which does. An earlier form required the identifiers to have been read live
and was therefore green here and red on a runner, which is the worst direction for that asymmetry.
Drift between the snapshot and the lifecycle is a separate parity check that skips when no checkout
is reachable. This mirrors the pattern this repository already uses for lifecycle-generated data:
vendor a copy, pin it, and gate it, rather than checking the sibling repository out on a runner.
