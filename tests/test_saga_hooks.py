"""Hook-manifest contracts for Saga: what is registered, and what must never come back.

This module was written after the lease retirement (#356, #677/U5) to pin two things: that no lease
registration survives anywhere in `hooks.json`, and that the hooks sharing the deleted hook's matcher
blocks were still armed afterwards -- the guard against a manifest edit taking a neighbour with it.

Issue 1030 removed four more hooks (the delegation tripwire, the delegation stop audit, the
team-spawn residency check, and the team teardown), and the five teardown-behaviour cases that lived
here retired with the hook whose behaviour they described. Both original contracts survive, with the
neighbour list updated to hooks that still exist: a manifest edit that removes four registrations is
exactly the moment the neighbour guard earns its keep.
