"""The lifecycle's issue comment is rendered, and it has to actually be posted.

For a long time `work/SKILL.md` §4.3 said only "render and hand the comment to mission-control",
which is prose with no command in it — so nothing ran. Two complete lifecycles merged and closed
with **zero comments** on their issues, and GitHub's own auto-close from the pull request stood in
for the update the whole time.

Everything else had been built: the op is in the certificate allowlist, `board_progression` stamps an
idempotency marker into the body, and mission-control's `issue comment` verb performs the write. The
only missing piece was the instruction to run it, so what is pinned here is that the instruction
exists and still names something real.
