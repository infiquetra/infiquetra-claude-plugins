"""Issue #923 (plan U2): surfaced plan-save failures and the finished-plan routing contract.

Two defects, two repairs, both pinned here:

* **Save failures name the stranded plan document** (plan KTD2: a named failure, not a
  transaction). A filesystem failure while writing the tick already exits non-zero, but a
  bare traceback never names the plan document now left on disk with NO saga state
  referencing it. The CLI save path catches the ``OSError`` and names the ``--plan-path``
  document. The negative test engineers a REAL filesystem failure — the saga directory
  exists as a regular file, so ``mkdir`` inside ``save()`` raises — and asserts the raised
  failure and the non-zero exit, not a log line.
* **A finished plan routes onward, never back into /plan** (plan KTD1: the producer
  changes, the router does not). Phase 5.3 writes ``--phase-status complete`` on every
  save variant; the ``/loop`` dispatch table routes ``plan`` / ``complete`` onward to
  ``/doc-review``. The three contract surfaces are pinned equal so they cannot drift apart
  again, and Phase 5.3's exit-status instruction is pinned present.
