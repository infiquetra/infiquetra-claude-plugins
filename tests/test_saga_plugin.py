    # default, with one verdict-log entry per suggested role. Bumped from 1.0.0, the saga
    # version on origin/parent/1018 at 994443ea.
    # Predecessor 1.0.0: the removals of issue
    # #1030 — eleven commands and nine skills gone, four hooks deregistered and deleted, both saga
    # agents gone, and the sandbox-spawn project instruction replaced. Bumped over 0.172.0, the saga
    # version on origin/parent/1018 at b264f154, re-read at this merge turn. 0.172.0 was chosen from
    # the same base by issue #1039, which is why this card skipped it rather than colliding: two
    # cards writing an identical version string never conflict, and the collision merges silently.
    #
    # NOT 1.0.0, which the card names. 1.0.0 is that card's name for the complete release, and this
    # is not it: the script families are still here, blocked on the cc-workflows finding recorded in
    # docs/work-sessions/2026-09-20-issue-1030-removals-and-release.md. A version says what shipped,
    # and taking 1.0.0 now would leave the complete release with no number to be.
    #
    # Predecessor 0.172.0 was issue #1039: /qa becomes the lifecycle's functional test — ten
    # prescribed strategies as data, a per-repository profile, a widen-only advisory judgment,
    # three-status drivers, one evidence envelope each in the run record, and a counted verdict.
    # The health score and its test are removed; the release step no longer reports a blocked
    # scenario as a pass.
    #
    # Predecessor 0.171.0 was issue #1028: the merge turn, the release step, the
    # lifecycle-boundary board interface and the allowed-submission enforcement. That card and issue
    # #1027 BOTH took 0.170.0 against 23959a80, and the collision merged silently: two cards
    # writing an identical version string never conflict, so the manifest and the marketplace entry
    # came through clean and the only signal was two bodies under one changelog heading.
    # Predecessor 0.170.0 was issue #1027: /work becomes the build loop — the exit criterion is
    # written in the run record at admission and read rather than judged, and build_loop.py runs it
    # and records every result under the unit row's `build_loop` key. The five ship-ceremony
    # modules are removed with their tests, the hook entry and their importers.
    # Predecessor 0.169.0 was issue #1029: every lifecycle skill ends by doing the next step in the
    # same turn, a SessionStart hook announces the run record's next_step for a live run and
    # nothing for a done step, a closed run, or no record, and a local-only UserPromptSubmit hook
    # names the command an operator's text is about.
    # Predecessor 0.168.0: the run record reference documents the
    # `units` rows as an extension point and names the three keys the orchestrate plugin adds to a
    # unit row (issue #1025).
    # Predecessor 0.167.0: Work no longer offers an in-process external-engine second opinion; the
    # offer's prose and routing leave the work skill and its continuation reference, and
    # plugins/saga/scripts/second_opinion.py is deleted with no live consumer, while the
    # external-content trust boundary survives with its guard narrowed to the one remaining call
    # site (issue #938).
    # Predecessor 0.166.0: /plan ends by dispatching the plan
    # review to the Plan Reviewer and looping on repair until no P0 or P1 remains, the /work floor
    # gate stays blocking on the operator's one-word override alone, the Workflow-backend and
    # team-execution prose moves to references/workflow-backend.md, and team_emitter.py and
    # spec_table.py are removed (issue #1026). Bumped from 0.165.0, the saga version on
    # origin/parent/1018 at 542e9810: issue #1001 took 0.165.0 while this card's suite ran, so this
    # card renumbered above it rather than shipping a colliding version.
    # Predecessor 0.165.0: code review becomes a policy-free
    # executor -- it reads the lens declaration from the run record, resolves review_roster.v1 with
    # the lifecycle repository's own generator, computes the verdict from that catalogue's
    # strictness ladder, writes review_result.v2 into the run record, and publishes exactly one
    # pull-request comment and never an approving review. The plugin's private fourteen-lens
    # roster is deleted (issue #1001). Bumped from 0.164.0, the saga version on
    # origin/parent/1018 at 4e951f0e.
    # Predecessor 0.164.0: /work and /code-review stand role and
    # lens-reviewer sessions up through agent-launcher's roster helper, which closes only the panes
    # the run record says it created (issue #1024).
    # Predecessor 0.163.0: one JSON run record per issue,
    # outside every worktree and addressed by an absolute path, plus the admission questionnaire
    # asked once at the front of /plan issue (issue #1023). Bumped from 0.161.0, the saga version
    # on origin/parent/1018 at 550ae6ce; the fold of main into that branch then renumbered the
    # tier-overlay release to 0.162.0, which 0.163.0 still clears.
    # Predecessor 0.162.0: the per-repository tier overlay
    # reads through one implementation in fleet-core (issue #1021); renumbered from 0.161.0
    # when main was folded into parent/1018.
    # Predecessor 0.161.0: shaping_judgments.py asks the eleven advisory typed judgments inside
    # /ideate, /brainstorm and /office-hours through the fleet-core TypeSafe client (issue #1037).
    # Predecessor 0.160.0: parse_issue.py gains --flags and
    # --issue, which widen the five keyword flags with a model judgment (widen-only: a keyword
    # flag stays set whatever the model answers) and report the seven approval boundaries
    # advisorily; the journal-nudge hook asks the same way when the feat/fix prefix did not
    # already nudge, stays silent on any failure, and never blocks (issue #1036).
    # Predecessor 0.159.3: plan_save_proof.py carries a
    # command-line entrypoint that names the proof and the command that runs it, serves it at
    # exit 0 for --help, and refuses every other direct invocation at exit 2 with an empty
    # stdout; PyYAML moved to its point of use so that --help works without it (issue #998).
    # Predecessor 0.159.2: plan_save_contract.py imports
    # PyYAML at first use instead of at module scope, so an interpreter without it gets the
    # documented refusal rather than a traceback at the drift exit code, and --help still
    # works (issue #997). Predecessor 0.159.1: a BaseException raised by the
    # checkout that plan_save_contract.py executes stays inside the JSON envelope, at both
    # seams where that code runs (issue #996). Predecessor 0.159.0: accepted-result consistency
    # and lifecycle-namespaced fix identifiers (issue #908 children #894, #899).
    # Predecessor 0.158.0: shared Saga readiness owner with
    # Mission Control delegation (issue #942). Predecessor — issue #926 (unit P5, issue #918
    # Wave Two):
    # Plan's documentation corrections -- the derived-state sentence, the board-move trigger
    # clause, the effort-emission comment's native-vs-proxy description, and the saga-spec
    # /plan consumer row -- plus the two drift checks that keep them from relapsing.
    # Successor to the cycle-2 repair of the integrated review's
    # WK2-WK4 findings: the /qa preamble and certificate comment issue #930 named, the halt/allowlist
    # attribution, a CLI for the build-unit tier resolver, validation of an explicit plan tier, and
    # three guard tests that could not fail. Successor to issue #930's maintenance sweep at 0.154.0
    # — teardown as fifth ceremony call, first-time move, gated/allowlist separation,
    # and the full artifact_pointer path.
    # Successor to issue #929's build-unit tier resolution at 0.153.0
    # Successor to issue 912's handoff envelope schema 1.1 at 0.156.0, which took that
    # version on origin/main while this branch was in review; the bump is re-derived
