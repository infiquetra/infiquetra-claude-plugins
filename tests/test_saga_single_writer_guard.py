"""#812 single-writer guard: saga does not compose board Stage/Status writes.

Step-1 inventory (launch pin 2026-08-25, live ``flow field-options`` / field list):

- Operations (#3), Asgard (#2), CAMPPS (#4): fields are Title, Assignees, Status,
  Labels, Linked pull requests, Milestone, Repository, Reviewers, Parent issue,
  Sub-issues progress, Created, Updated, Closed, Objective, Priority.
- ``Status`` is present on all three boards. ``Stage`` is present on none.
- Operations Status options: Idea, Shaping, Ready, Active, Verify, Done.
- Saga GraphQL mutations that write a project field: none. The only ``--field``
  Status/Stage argv is the mission-control submission in
  ``plugins/saga/scripts/board_progression.py:default_board_writer``.

The named in-scope failure: the single-writer policy exists by operator ruling
but nothing enforced it, so a future saga script could silently re-introduce
direct board composition. This guard is the smallest enforcement.
