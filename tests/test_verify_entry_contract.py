"""Contract checks for the Verify entry (W8, SDLC issue #89, R69/R71/R70).

Work and QA are Markdown skills, so these tests read the shipped skill text directly (the
house pattern, as in ``test_work_review_contract.py``). They assert the Active/Verify
boundary that the ``verify_entry`` block of ``config/sdlc-schema.json`` in
``infiquetra-sdlc`` encodes: no pre-merge Verify write survives, and the post-merge path
names the real conditions.

Deliberate failure direction: the region assertions anchor on the ``### 5.3`` / ``### 5.4``
phase headings; if a restructure removes those anchors the helper asserts loudly rather
than passing vacuously.
