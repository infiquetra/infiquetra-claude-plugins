"""U3 #930 — maintenance sweep prose contracts.

Pins that Work's post-merge ceremony names all five calls. The /loop claim and the
artifact-pointer path cases retired with the surfaces they guarded: issue #1030 removed the /loop
skill and archived the team-execution plugin that owned the pointer script.

The six stale sentences in #930 were re-resolved at preflight: three were
located and repaired (teardown, first-time move, artifact_pointer path, and
the Phase-4.4 gated/allowlist conflation plus the orphaned skip-silently line)
and three remain unlocated after a repository-wide search — the stale /qa
preamble, the stale certificate comment, and the command stub. The latter are
recorded as explicit non-findings in the work-session and the pull request
description rather than silent non-fixes, per OQ3. This test pins the four
provable prose contracts; the residue is documented as non-findings, not
closed on silent.
