"""Measure whether a `UserPromptSubmit` hook can suggest a saga command fast enough.

Issue 1038, an exploration. The plan is
`docs/plans/2026-09-19-issue-1038-prompt-suggestion-latency-plan.md`; the deliverable it
feeds is `docs/analysis/2026-09-19-prompt-suggestion-latency.md`.

The question is not "how fast is the API" -- that was already measured at roughly a third
of a second. It is whether the *hook*, which pays a process start and whatever the client
costs on top, can stay inside 400 milliseconds at the 95th percentile, and which shape of
persistent local client changes that answer.

Six shapes are timed, plus a floor:

* ``floor`` -- a process that starts, prints nothing and exits. The irreducible cost of
  having a hook at all. If this exceeds the target, no client design can rescue it.
* ``s0`` / ``s1`` -- a cold process making one, then two sequential API requests.
* ``s2`` / ``s3`` -- the same two request counts against a resident process.
* ``s4`` -- a resident process serving an answer from the client's own cache: no network.
* ``s5`` -- a resident process that answers from the *previous* prompt and computes this
  one in the background. The only shape with no blocking call on the critical path.

Everything is timed the way Claude Code pays for it (plan R4): wall clock around a
subprocess spawn, its output read, and its exit -- never an in-process figure.

Three properties this module exists to keep honest:

* **The key is never touched here.** Only `typesafe_client` reads ``TYPESAFE_API_KEY``, at
  request-build time, into one header. This file never reads it, prints it or stores it.
* **Only synthetic prompts are sent.** The corpus is hand-written for this exploration.
  No operator prompt, no transcript, no issue body (plan R3).
* **Nothing is left running.** The resident process is started and stopped by this harness
  in a ``finally``, and its identifier is reported so a caller can confirm it is gone.

Run the measurement::

    python3 tools/prompt_suggestion_latency.py measure --trials 30 --out results.json

Tests drive the pieces directly with a fake client and touch no network.
